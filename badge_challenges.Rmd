# Badge Challenge System

There will be four "badge challenges," three mid-semester and one during finals week, during which you can collect statistics "badges." There are a total 15 badges, each representing a core skill for the course. Note: The coloring of the badge challenges matches the coloring of the lecture schedule.

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQM-5FVt5BKJZsfElEV19NwD2MXGgSVUfGLB7dUoD0MbCU6Dkzqx66UMxbgqMaiS6H8CP8numV5Xaf-/pubhtml?gid=67598343&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false" width="100%" height="610"></iframe>

As you can see, the first badge challenge will have the first 5 badges available, the second will have the first 10, and the third and fourth badge challenge will have all 15 badges. During each badge challenge, you can attempt as many or as few of the available badges as you would like. **Your goal, by the end of the semester, is to collect all 15 badges.** 

There are four levels for each badge: *G* – Gold, *S* – Silver, *B* – Bronze, and *X* – cannot be assessed. The most recent level for each badge is the recorded level. This means that if you earn a gold level for badge 1 on the first challenge, then you never have to attempt this badge again. But, if you earn silver for badge 4 on the first challenge and then a bronze for badge 4 on the second challenge, your current level for badge 4 is bronze. **Thus, you do not need to (nor should you) attempt all badges on each challenge,** but you do need to collect all 15 badges by the end of the term.

At the end of the semester, your collected badges and badge levels will be converted into points for the 45% of your final grade assigned to badge challenges (see [syllabus](syllabus.html#evaluation)):

**Why are we doing this?**

1. To remove the pressure, stress, and performance anxiety associated with conventional exams. The "badge challenge" system *guarantees* more than one chance to **master** each badge.
1. The "badge challenge" system system allows for you to iteratively improve your statistical skills throughout the semester. Each badge challenge is an opportunity for you to practice the *only* the statistical skills that you are ready to demonstrate. For example, if you've already **mastered** a particular badge, you can focus your studying elsewhere in a targetted fashion.
1. Since you are given the opportunity to **master** all 15 badges after the first three badge challenges, the fourth badge challenge during exam week becomes merely an opportunity to revise and improve your grade.
1. The "badge challenge" system is aligned with the **mastery**-based learning pedagogical paradigm, which encourages a ["growth mindset"](Mastery-based grading: from minimum mindset to a growth mindset){target="_blank"} as opposed to a minimum/fixed mindset.
