Everything in this course builds up to the group project, where there is
only one learning goal: *Engage in the data/science research pipeline in as
faithful a manner as possible while maintaining a level suitable for novices.*

hint_1 <- "This is the phase of the project that is the least straightforward. Thus, we recommend you start early and get help during the various 220 office hours posted on Moodle early and often."
hint_2 <- "This phase may require revisions to your original choice of data and visits to the Spinelli tutoring center for help with data wrangling. "
```


In order to break down the task and minimize end-of-semester stress, you'll be working on the project in four phases:

1. Project data: Propose a data set for your project. `r hint_1`
1. Project proposal: Ensure you can work with your data in R by performing an exploratory data analysis. `r hint_2`
1. Project submission: Make an initial submission of your project. You will skip some of the sections for now and only complete them after we have covered inference for regression in class. After you submit your work, you will get instructor feedback.
1. Project resubmission: Incorporate your instructor feedback from the project submission phase, complete the remaining sections, and resubmit your project. You will only be graded on your project resubmission.

# 1. Project Data {#data} 

## Form groups

1. Form groups of 2-3 students.
    + You **must** all be registered for the same lab section, because certain labs will be devoted to working on the project.
    + All groups members are expected to contribute and you will all be held accountable for your contributions in peer evaluations.
1. Choose a group name. 
1. Assign a "team/group leader" role for each of the four phases of this project to everyone in your team at least once. The team/group leader will have extra administrative duties at each phase. Ex: making Moodle submissions, filling out Google Forms, etc.
1. The team leader for this first "Project Data" phase will then:
    + Create a Slack direct message (DM) that includes all 1) your group members, 2) your instructor, and 3) your lab instructor. Ask all questions relating to your specific project here. That way everyone is on the same page.
    + Submit your group information using the "Project groups Google Form" on Moodle.
1. If you are looking for a group to join, please fill out the "Project groups Google Form" on Moodle.



## Find data

**`r hint_1`**

### Step 1

Get a sense for the requirements of this project phase by reading the [example data proposal](static/project/project_data_example.html){target="_blank"}.

### Step 2

Find a data set that fits these specifications. Note your data may need a little wrangling from its original form.

1. (If available) An [identification variable](https://moderndive-bert.netlify.com/1-getting-started.html#identification-vs-measurement-variables){target="_blank"} that uniquely identifies each observation in each row. 
1. A numerical outcome variable $y$. Note: binary outcomes variables with 0/1 values are not technically numerical.
1. Two explanatory variables:
    + A numerical explanatory variable $x_1$. Note: this can be some notion of time.
    + A categorical explanatory variable $x_2$ that has between 3-5 levels. Note: If your data has more than 5 levels, they can be collapsed into 5 using data wrangling later.
1. At least 50 observations/rows.

**Where is this heading?**: For the next project phase (project proposal), you will be making a visualization like this [one](static/project/project_proposal_example.html#coloredscatterplot){target="_blank"}. *If you can make a visualization like this one, then your data is set for the rest of the project.* 



### Step 3

Download the following <a href="static/project/project_data.Rmd" download>`project_data.Rmd`</a> template R Markdown file and fill it in, using the example data proposal from Step 1 as your guide.



## What to submit when?

**Due Mon 2/24 at 11pm.** Only the group leader for this phase will make a single submission on behalf of the whole group. They will:

1. The `project_data.Rmd` R Markdown file
1. The `project_data.html` HTML report file
1. Only if your data is confidential or has private information, submit your Excel or CSV file as well. Otherwise your should publish your data on Google Sheets following [these steps](https://twitter.com/rudeboybert/status/1055821833512071168){target="_blank"}. 


## Possible sources for data

* Best option: data from your own research or other courses. If you are interested in biology, check out Marney Pratt's [lab page](http://www.science.smith.edu/pratt/projects/){target="_blank"}.
* Next best option: data for a topic you are interested in. For help on this, visit Spinelli Center Data Counselor [Osman Keshawarz](https://www.smith.edu/qlc/tutoring.html?colDataCnslr=open#PanelDataCnslr){target="_blank"}.
* Next best option: Online data repositories such as (but not limited to):
    + [data.world](https://data.world/){target="_blank"}
    + [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources){target="_blank"}
    + [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch){target="_blank"}
    + [StatLib Datasets Archive](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/)
* You may not use the following data:
    + Any datasets used in this class, either in ModernDive or in any of the examples.
    + Any data from the data journalism website FiveThirtyEight.com

## Hints

* When you have questions:
    + If possible, please ask questions that you think the entire class would like to know the answer to in the `project` channel in Slack.
    + Ask more individual questions in the group DM that includes all group members + your instructor + your lab instructor.
* Only minimal data wrangling using the `dplyr` package is expected at this time; you will be doing more for the "project proposal" phase coming up. That being said, feel free to experiment!
* Don't forget to consult the office hours calendar posted on Moodle when you need help. Most of you will likely need it!

# Important note!!!


> We have posted all four phases of the project at once to give you a sense of what to expect. However, the format and requirements of all four phases of the project will likely slightly change as the semester progresses. **Therefore we suggest that you do not start any upcoming phases of the project until you've been instructed to.**

# 2. Project Proposal {#proposal}

**`r hint_2`**

* Read the example [project proposal](static/project/project_proposal_example.html){target="_blank"}. <!--You can also download the <a href="static/project/project_proposal.Rmd" download>`project_proposal_example.Rmd`</a> file that created Dr. Jenny Smetzer and Albert's example.-->
* Download the following <a href="static/project/project_proposal.Rmd" download>`project_proposal.Rmd`</a> template R Markdown file.
<!--
TODO for Albert: Finish ModernDive 
* For data wrangling tips, check out Dr. Jenny Smetzer and Albert's [Become an R Data Ninja](static/project/project_tips.html){target="_blank"} page! You don't need to read all the examples, just read the section headers to see if it addresses your data wrangling needs! You can also download the <a href="static/project/project_tips.Rmd" download>`project_tips.Rmd`</a> file.

# Grading Rubric

* You are only graded on your project resubmission.
* Your project is worth 30% of your final grade. The 30% is distributed as follows:
    1. 2.5%: Are all necessary files submitted and did you complete the "SDS/MTH 220 Exit Survey" Google Form?
    1. 27.5%: Based on this rough [guideline criteria](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRGs5tNHneQX7mKfQWEMEpxRm9iu79b63KBO0LnfB10KIphB0Igq_p2_yw-sRRjdhhB9Vck4LRU3vV3/pubhtml?gid=227075812&single=true){target="_blank"}.
