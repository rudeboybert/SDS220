```


In order to break down the task and minimize end-of-semester stress, you'll be working on the project in four phases (see course schedule for due dates):

1. Project proposal: Propose a data set for your project.
1. Project EDA: Perform an exploratory data analysis using visualizations and numerical summaries.
1. Project initial submission: Make an initial submission of your project. You will skip some of the sections for now and only complete them after we have covered inference for regression in class. After you submit your work, you will get instructor feedback.
1. Project resubmission: Incorporate your instructor feedback from the initial submission phase, complete the remaining sections, and resubmit your project. You will only be graded on your project resubmission.

# 1. Project proposal {#proposal} 

<!--
Notes to future self: 

* Forming groups
    + ABSOLUTELY SPLIT the "form groups" and "find data" phases into two parts. 
    Assigning them at the same time causes the following problem: we don't
    know which individuals need a group until really late, leaving not much time to
    find data. Split the "form groups" into it's own phase, and do this early.
    + Stretch goal: Instead of assigning groups at random to people who need them,
    IF you have the mental bandwidth, use a blocked randomization scheme. For ex: by
    major or some interest (sports team, hometown, etc). That way there will be less
    potential for disagreement over what dataset to use, which Adriana B. pointed
    out happened in her 192 mini-project 3.
* Finding data: Students have NO CLUE how to search for data and we suffer from curse of 
knowledge. So next time
    + Have the Data Counselor comes to a lab and live-demo finding data.
    + As a problem set/lab, have students each find their own dataset with minimal
    restrictions (which they can later bring to table for data collection phase).
    Put it on a Google Sheet so that everyone finds a dataset. And add "why do you
    think it's interesting"
--> 


## Form groups

1. Form groups of 2-3 students.
    + Preferably all group members are in the same lab section.
    + All groups members are expected to contribute and you will all be held accountable for your contributions in peer evaluations.
    + If you need a group fill out this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSedfpweiZMki1J9MVeer8P1WBwVdGLF39hsVrQ4LlEor-5S_A/viewform){target="_blank"} by **Wed 2/16 at 5pm**. I will assign you a group before lab
1. Assign a group leader. The team/group leader will have a few extra administrative duties at each phase. Ex: making submissions, filling out Google Forms, etc.


## Select a data set

You have two options for your data set:

1. Choose from these 10 vetted [datasets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RkDW6ngTVbvZt98E8PTQAb32U2uJt7vT4d9HjxLYwUw/edit){target="_blank"}. The variables fit the requirements for this project and the data require no additional data wrangling.
1. If you would like to use your own data, it must have:
    1. An [identification variable](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html#identification-vs-measurement-variables){target="_blank"} that uniquely identifies each observation in each row. 
    1. A numerical outcome variable $y$. Note: binary outcomes variables with 0/1 values are not technically numerical.
    1. Two explanatory variables:
        a) A numerical explanatory variable $x_1$. Note: this can be some notion of time.
        a) A categorical explanatory variable $x_2$ that has between 3-5 levels. Note: If your data has more than 5 levels, they can be collapsed into 5 using data wrangling later.
    1. At least 50 observations/rows.


## What to submit

By Thu 2/24 9pm:

1. The group leader will create a Slack direct message (DM) that includes all 1) your group members, 2) your instructor, and 3) your lab instructor. Please ask all questions to myself and Beth here so everyone is on the same page. 
1. Only the group leader: Fill out this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd9P4jEhBzHQga-EX7_Vz0MOia2YgxlDu6wD96TzT0YSmYbCA/viewform){target="_blank"} with your group information

# 2. Project EDA {#EDA}

## To Do

1. Work on the `final_project.Rmd`
    1. Download file from Moodle
    1. Knit to HTML (not PDF) and read over once
    1. Complete Sections 1 (Introduction), 2 (EDA), and 5 (Honor Code) only. You will complete the other sections later.
    1. Only group leader will make single submission on behalf of whole group (see below)
1. Ask questions:
    1. For general project questions that would apply to all groups: ask in `final_project` channel in Slack
    1. For questions specific to your group: ask in group Slack DM you created in project proposal phase
1. Be mindful of your group members
    1. Life happens, especially this semester. If something comes up, let your partners know. Do not ghost on your partners.
    1. If an issue arises, do not resort to passive aggressive electronic messages. Make a good faith attempt to say how you feel in person.
    1. If the issue is still not resolved, Slack DM Prof. Kim.
1. Tips:
    1. Knit early, knit often
    1. For tips on how to make your HTML document look professional, consult the R Markdown tips listed in RStudio Menu Bar -> Help -> Markdown Quick Reference



## What to submit

By Thu 3/10 9pm only the group leader will submit on Moodle:

1. The `final_project.Rmd` R Markdown file. This file **must** knit.
1. The `final_project.html` HTML output file

Extension requests count against all group members. For example, say Avon, Stringer, and Marlo are in a group. If Marlo fills out the extension request form requesting 2 days, then 2 days will deducted from all three members' 5 days extension request. 


<!--

1. The Spinelli Center evening tutoring hours on Sun-Thurs 7-9pm. All student tutors there have taken [SDS 192 Data Science](https://www.smith.edu/academics/academic-program/curriculum/course-search?term=Spring+2020&dept=Statistical+and+Data+Sciences&instr=&credits=&course_numb=192&course_keywd=&op=Submit&form_build_id=form-wFN3QGp-YpOHvSETMIKm1Wzwq1snu0oWeSR1I3dUByQ&form_id=campus_course_search_basic_search_form){target="_blank"} and can thus help you get the data into the appropriate format. 
1. Check out ModernDive Appendix C on [data wrangling "tips & tricks"](https://moderndive-bert.netlify.com/c-appendixc){target="_blank"}, where you'll find example code on:
    + C.1.1 Dealing with `NA` missing values
    + C.1.3 Showing money on an axis in a plot
    + C.1.4 Changing values inside cells
    + C.1.5 Converting a numerical variable to a categorical one
    + C.1.6 Computing proportions
    + C.1.7 Dealing with `%`, commas, and `$` symbols in your data

# 3. Project initial submission {#submission}

## To Do
