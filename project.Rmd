Everything in this course builds up to the group project, where there is
only one learning goal: *Engage in the data/science research pipeline in as
faithful a manner as possible while maintaining a level suitable for novices.*

# 1. Project Data {#data} 

## Form groups

**All groups members are expected to contribute and you will all be held accountable for your contributions in peer evaluations.**

1. Form groups of 2-3 students. If you need a group to join, please Slack your instructor.
1. Designate a group leader who will do a little administrative work.
1. Pick a group name. 
1. The group leader will then create two Slack direct messages (DM):
    * One with all your group members + your instructor + your lab instructor. You'll ask group-specific questions here.
    * One with only your group members. Send all private messages amongst yourselves here.
1. Complete the project groups Google Form posted on Moodle.

## Find data

**This is likely the most time-consuming portion of the entire project, so we recommend you start early.**

1. Read moderndive for important background knowledge and tools for this project phase:
    + Chapter 1.4.4 on identification vs measurement variables.
    + Chapter 4.1 on importing spreadsheet data into R.
1. Read the [example data proposal](static/project/project_data_example.html){target="_blank"}.
1. Download the following <a href="static/project/project_data.Rmd" download>`project_data.Rmd`</a> template R Markdown file.
1. Find a dataset that matches the requirements spelled out in the above `project_data.Rmd` template R Markdown file. Possible sources include data from your own projects, [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch){target="_blank"}, [data.world](https://data.world/){target="_blank"}, and  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets){target="_blank"}. Consult the Spinelli Center Data Counselor for help (see syllabus for contact info). <!-- Cannot use data from 538? -->
1. The group leader only will submit the following files on Moodle on behalf of the whole group:
    1. The `project_data.Rmd` R Markdown file
    1. The `project_data.html` HTML report file
    1. Only if your data is confidential or has private information, submit your Excel or CSV file as well. Otherwise your should publish your data on Google Sheets. 

Notes:

* When you have questions:
    + Please ask questions that you think the entire class would like to know the answer to in the `project` channel in Slack.
    + Ask more individual questions in the group DM that includes all group members + your instructor + your lab instructor.
* Only minimal data wrangling using the `dplyr` package is expected at this time; you will be doing more for the "project proposal" phase after you're experienced. That being said, feel free to experiment!
* Don't forget to use the Spinelli 7-9pm tutoring hours (see syllabus for time/place).

# 2. Project Proposal {#proposal}

* Read the example [project proposal](static/project/project_proposal_example.html){target="_blank"}. <!--You can also download the <a href="static/project/project_proposal.Rmd" download>`project_proposal_example.Rmd`</a> file that created Dr. Jenny Smetzer and Albert's example.-->
* Download the following <a href="static/project/project_proposal.Rmd" download>`project_proposal.Rmd`</a> template R Markdown file.
<!--
TODO for Albert: Finish ModernDive 
* For data wrangling tips, check out Dr. Jenny Smetzer and Albert's [Become an R Data Ninja](static/project/project_tips.html){target="_blank"} page! You don't need to read all the examples, just read the section headers to see if it addresses your data wrangling needs! You can also download the <a href="static/project/project_tips.Rmd" download>`project_tips.Rmd`</a> file.
-->
1. The group leader only will submit the following files on Moodle on behalf of the whole group:
    1. The `project_proposal.Rmd` R Markdown file
    1. The `project_proposal.html` HTML report file
    1. Only if your data is confidential or has private information, submit your Excel or CSV file as well. Otherwise your should publish your data on Google Sheets.

    + Section 1: Introduction
    + Section 2: Exploratory data analysis
    + Section 3 subsections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3: Multiple linear regression: Methods, Model Results, Interpreting the regression table.    
1. Download the following <a href="static/project/project_submission.Rmd" download>`project_submission.Rmd`</a> R Markdown file
    + Complete the following sections:
        + Section 1: Introduction

        + Section 4: Discussion. You will write this conclusion based on the results of sections 3.4 and 3.5.
1. The group leader only will submit the following files on Moodle on behalf of the whole group:
    1. The `project_submission.Rmd` R Markdown file with sections 1, 2, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 completed
    1. The `project_submission.html` HTML report file.
    1. Only if your data is confidential or has private information, submit your Excel or CSV file as well. Otherwise your should publish your data on Google Sheets.

    + Section 3 subsections 3.4, 3.5: Inference for multiple regression
    + Section 4: Discussion.
1. Using the same `project_submission.Rmd` file you submitted for the project submission phase:

# Grading Rubric

* You are only graded on your project resubmission.
* Your project is worth 30% of your final grade. The 30% is distributed as follows:
    1. 2.5%: Are all necessary files submitted and did you complete the "SDS/MTH 220 Exit Survey" Google Form?
    1. 27.5%: Based on this rough [guideline criteria](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRGs5tNHneQX7mKfQWEMEpxRm9iu79b63KBO0LnfB10KIphB0Igq_p2_yw-sRRjdhhB9Vck4LRU3vV3/pubhtml?gid=227075812&single=true){target="_blank"}.
