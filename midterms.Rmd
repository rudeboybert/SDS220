# Midterm format

The standards based grading format for the midterms in this course are based on Marney Pratt's [BIO 131](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_FB2EHtqTEpd1RJHb6SfyV19rgXlrjNKbsxhPh9UC6w/edit){target="_blank"}. 

## Grading

For each learning goal question you attempt in each midterm, you will be assigned a proficiency which also translates to a numerical score:

Proficiency | Score 
:--- | :---
Excellent, exceeds standard | 4
Almost Excellent, only minor problems | 3.5
Proficient, meets standard (understand the idea generally, but some mistakes or get confused by subtleties) | 3
Approaching, doesnâ€™t fully meet standard but is progressing (understand it somewhat but have misconceptions, gaps in knowledge, or make serious mistakes) | 2
Beginning, does not meet standard (know a little bit, but not enough to really use it for anything) | 1
No attempt made | 0

The 4-point grading scale will be translated into letter grades as follows, where all [15 learning goals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQM-5FVt5BKJZsfElEV19NwD2MXGgSVUfGLB7dUoD0MbCU6Dkzqx66UMxbgqMaiS6H8CP8numV5Xaf-/pubhtml?gid=323806801&single=true) are weighted equally in an overall average:

Score | 3.60-4.00 | 3.20-3.59 | 3.00-3.19 | 2.80-2.99 | 2.60-2.79 | 2.40-2.59 | 2.20-2.39 | 2.00-2.19 | 1.66-1.99 | 1.33-1.65 | 1.00-1.32 | 0-0.99
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | 
Letter Grade | A | A- | B+ | B | B- | C+ | C | C- | D+ | D | D- | E

# Midterm I {#midtermI}

## Administrative notes

1. Friday 3/4 through Sunday 3/6. See times above
1. You will be given 120 mins to complete it (including transit time to writing areas), however I try to time it so that it will take much less than that. In other words, you should have plenty of time to complete it without rushing.
1. You are allowed a single 3x5 inch index card of notes (double-sided ok). You are required to submit your index card with your midterm, which you will then get returned to you. 


## What to Study

1. Everything relating to [learning goals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQM-5FVt5BKJZsfElEV19NwD2MXGgSVUfGLB7dUoD0MbCU6Dkzqx66UMxbgqMaiS6H8CP8numV5Xaf-/pubhtml?gid=323806801&single=true){target="_blank"} 1-5:
    1. Lecture chalk talks
    1. Labs/problem sets (PS05 solutions will be posted after all PS05's have been submitted)
    1. Book readings
1. You don't need to write complete and perfectly function code, however you might need to
    1. Understand presented code
    1. Fill in the blanks
    1. Write pseudocode (learning goal 2). See below:

    
## What is "pseudocode"?

Think of pseudocode as a recipe, blue print, or algorithm outline that balances:

1. Being *just specific enough* that someone who reads it can walk through the steps unambiguously
1. But *not being so specific* that it has to work perfectly when typed into R
