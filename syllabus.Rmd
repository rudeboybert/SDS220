# How can I succeed in this class?

Ask yourself:

* **When I have questions or don't understand something:**
    + *"Am I asking questions in class?"*
    + *"Am I asking questions on Slack in the `#questions` channel?"* Even better: *"Am I answering my peers' questions on Slack?"*
    + *"Having I been going to the Spinelli tutoring center for help on R and the tidyverse?"*
    + *"Have I been coming to office hours?"*
* **Lectures and readings:**
    + *"Am I staying on top Slack notifications sent between lectures?"* If you need help developing a notification strategy that best suits your lifestyle, please speak to me. 
    + *"Am I attending lectures consistently?"*
    + *"During in-class activities, am I actually running code line-by-line and studying the outputs, or am I just going through the motions?"*
    + *"During in-class exercises, am I taking full advantage that I'm in the same place at the same time with the instructor, the lab assistants, and most importantly your peers, or am I browsing the web/texting the whole time?"*
    + *"Have I been doing the associated readings for each lecture?"*

# Revised: Evaluation {#evaluation}

## Weekly Problem Sets 15%

*Revised: The only change for problem sets are the due dates. See the course schedule posted on the [main page](index.html) of this course webpage.*

* Total of 9 problem sets.
* Each full problem set is worth 100 pts and each "lite" problem set is worth 50 pts. So there are total of 750 possible pts, however the final computation will be out of **600 pts**. In other words, you have a 750 - 600 = 150 point cushion.
* This means that you can decide to not hand in at least one full problem set any reason. It could be because you are ill, you forgot about the assignment, or you had too much work for your other courses. *Note that pre-planned “dropping” of labs should be used sparingly because we can not predict when life will happen (ie. illness, etc).* Alternatively, you could hand in all the problem sets and allow for smaller mistakes on each one to effectively be "waved."
* The problem sets in this class should be viewed as low-stakes opportunities to
practice, instead of evaluative tools used by the instructor to assign grades.
**Each problem set is worth less than 2% of your final grade**.

## Term Project 30% {#termproject}

*Revised: The third and fourth phases of the term project have been revised significantly. See the [Term Project](term_project.html) page for more details.*

See [Term Project](term_project.html) page. While your term project grade is only based on your final resubmission, your level of contributions at all the intermediate steps (data, proposal, and initial submission) will affect your engagement grade; see [Engagement](#engagement) below.

## Badge Challenges: 45%

*Revised: While the mechanics of taking/submitting the badge challenges have changed since we no longer have access to Seelye self-scheduled exams, the "mastery-based grading" philosophy of our badge challenges will remain the same. See the [Badge Challenges](badge_challenges.html) page for more details.*

See [Badge Challenges](badge_challenges.html) page. Note that is possible to satisfy all 15 badges in the first three badge challenges, making the 4th badge challenge an opportunity to revise and improve your grade.

## Engagement 10% {#engagement}

Being part of a professional community has many parts; we generate and 
consume knowledge, we review and critique work, and we present to and 
learn from each other. The edge of what we know is constantly being pushed
further and further as we discover new ideas, create new knowledge, and 
ask new questions. At times, we are computers, writers, and contractors, 
and then at other times, we serve as reviewers, mentors, and learners. The 
constancy is our willingness to be present and active within our professional 
community. With this in mind, in this course, your participation is expected, 
especially **you'll only get out of this class as much as you put in**. That 
being said, here are multiple pathways for you to stay engaged in this class: [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14PBmTU_wBTEI8j1lqZWFqFI3ETAD6N5qao-2ADQRTTM/edit){target="_blank"}.

Participation can take many forms, including but not limited to: attending 
class meetings, being active on our course slack, participating in discussion 
in class, offering ideas and questions in class or on slack. Beyond attending 
class, our class as a community will generate a list of what we believe are 
ways to engage and participate in our course. Adding to this list one way 
that you are called to participate in this course. If you find yourself unwilling 
or resistant to adding to this list, examine this. *What is holding you back?* 
*What would help propel you to action?*

The engagement part of the course will be graded with student input. In the week 
before spring break and during the last week of classes, you will be asked to 
complete a self-evaluation of your class engagement in context of the class 
engagement list. Your self-evaluations will be a critical part of determining 
this section of your grade, but not the only determining factor. 



## Policies

1. **Collaboration**: While we encourage you to work with your peers for problem
sets and labs, you must submit your own answers and not simple rewordings of
another's work. Furthermore, all collaborations must be explicitly acknowledged
in your submissions.
1. **Problem sets**:
    + No extensions will be granted without a dean's note.
    + To receive full credit, you must show your work and explain your reasoning in your solutions. 
    + Revised: All written problem sets must be handed in ~~by 9am on Mondays~~ at the appropriate due time on Gradescope. No emailed submissions will be accepted.
1. **Engagement**:
    + There are 4 reflective assignments for the course: 2 reflective writing assignments and the 2 self-evaluation forms. You should complete 3 of the four assignments. 
1. **Badge Challenges**:
    + No make-up badge challenges will be allowed without a dean's note. 
    + Timestamps for all midterms will be strictly enforced.
1. **Grading**: We reserve the right to not discuss any grading issues in class and instead direct you to office hours or after class.

# Academic Integrity

## Honor Code Principles

Being at a school with an Honor Code, like Smith, is a special privilege. 
The Honor Code goes beyond inviting students to act with integrity, instead 
it welcomes students as equal participants of the learning community, 
imbuing students with the same level of trust that we extend to our 
collaborators and colleagues. The Smith College Honor Code, established 
in 1944, and as stated in the Student Handbook, says:

> Smith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the 
> principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation 
> and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at 
> Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to 
> scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement 
> of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college 
> resources.

This trust bestowed to students in the Honor Code is the same trust that 
exists in and among researchers within a research community, the same trust 
that exists between us and our collaborators. Simply put, at Smith, under 
the Honor Code, I trust that you will each act with integrity, citing sources 
when you celebrate others’ ideas and noting who you work with when collaborating. 

This trust manifests in how assignments are created, in how work is completed, 
and in how we resolve instances where the trust has been broken. At an Honor Code 
school, assignments are created knowing that while there are resources online that 
can offer complete solutions, you are trusted to not seek out such complete 
resources and that if you do stumble on a solution guide, you will not use it. 
Under an Honor Code, students are expected to keep careful notes about the resources 
that they consult and the people that they collaborate with. We get to assume that 
the work handed in by a student is the creation of that student. Lastly, when there 
are violations of the Honor Code, the resolution is determined by a committee 
established by the community and trusted to seek restoration of the whole community’s 
trust through education and action. 

We regard the Honor Code with deep and profound respect. Being educators at an 
Honor Code school means we begin from a place of trust without any underlying 
suspicion of our students. Simply put, we - instructors and students - work from 
the assumption that all are acting in good faith and with the utmost integrity. 
This is an assumption that cannot be made at a school without an Honor code, 
and it is why it is a privilege to be both an instructor and a student at Smith 
under the Honor Code. 

## Honor Code Practicalities

The work you submit should be your own and created by you. We do encourage you 
to ask for help from your peers or myself when you have questions; however, 
copying is never allowed. The line between copying and helping is subtle. 
Below are a few guidelines:

* Do not share nor give your work with other students; instead, offer to discuss the big ideas of the task at hand. 
* Do not look at someone else’s work (including online solutions); instead, ask if you could talk with them about your ideas and share where you are getting stuck.
* Acknowledge those you talk or work with at the top of each assignment. We will not dock points for getting acknowledged help from others. If you generate a solution or an argument with someone, in addition to acknowledging that person, recreate the solution or argument on your own in your own words. 

If you think you may have crossed the line between helping and copying, please 
talk to your instructor or your lab instructor about it. Do not let us discover 
that the line was crossed. If a violation of the Honor Code is suspected, the 
student will be informed and will be given the opportunity to meet with the 
instructor. As recommended by the Academic Honor Board and in keeping with Smith 
tradition, the student will be given time to self-report, and after such time, 
the suspected violation will be reported to the Academic Honor Board by the instructor.
