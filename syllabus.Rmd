* **Objectives** (<a target="_blank" class="page-link" href="static/syllabus_slides.html">slides</a>): This semester you will
    1. Learn statistical inference through data science, not mathematics/probability theory.
    1. Engage in the data/science research pipeline in as faithful a manner as possible while maintaining a level suitable for novices.
    1. Develop your statistical literacy, a necessary ability for effective citizenship.

# Materials

We will draw from the following sources:

1. ["ModernDive: An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R"](https://moderndive.netlify.com/){target="_blank"} by Ismay and Kim (click link in menubar above).
1. ["OpenIntro: Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation"](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=isrs/){target="_blank"} by Diez, Barr, and Cetinkaya-Rundel
1. DataCamp: an online interactive environment for learning data science currently via R and Python. On top of the DataCamp courses we'll cover this semester, you have free access to [all their courses](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/all){target="_blank"} for 6 months.

# Expectations

As a student in this class:

1. **Communication**: You are expected to stay on top of announcements and
direct messages in Slack.
1. **Attendance**: You are not required to inform the instructor of *occasional* absenses.
However, you are resposible for asking your peers, and not the instructor, for
what you missed.
1. **Collaboration**: While I encourage you to work with your peers for problem
sets and labs, you must submit your own answers and not simple rewordings of
another's work. Furthermore, all collaborations must be explicitly acknowledged
in your submissions.
1. **Honor Code**: All your work must follow the [Smith College Academic Honor
Code
Statement](https://www.smith.edu/sao/handbook/socialconduct/honorcode.php){target="_blank"};
in particular all external sources must be cited in your submissions.

# Evaluation

## Weekly Problem Sets 10%

* The problem sets in this class should be viewed as low-stakes opportunities to
practice, instead of evaluative tools used by the instructor to assign grades.
* Assigned/due on Wednesdays.
* **More details coming when PS01 is assigned**

<!--
* No extensions for problem sets will be granted.
* Assignments will be graded on the following qualitative scale:
    1. `r set.seed(79);emo::ji("check")`-: You unfortunately struggled on this problem set and
    should go to office hours or to the tutoring center.
    1. `r set.seed(79);emo::ji("check")`: This is typically the most common grade. You did everything mostly well and there are no red flags. However,
    you should still compare your work to the posted solutions.
* Each `r set.seed(79);emo::ji("check")` is worth 1% up to 10%, with the lowest two scores dropped.
-->

## DataCamp Assignments 10%

* Assigned/due on Wednesdays.
* **More details coming when first DataCamp assignment is assigned.**

## Quizzes 5%

There will be 2-3 quizzes assigned during the course of the semester. They will always be announced the lecture before. 

## Term Project 25% {#termproject}

See [Term Project](term_project.html) page.

## Three Midterms: 45%

* There will be three self-scheduled midterms in the library. They are closed-book:
    1. Open on Friday 9/28 at 5pm, ends on Sunday 9/30 evening (Time TBD)
    2. Open on Friday 10/26 at 5pm, ends on Sunday 10/28 evening (Time TBD)
    3. Open on Friday 11/30 at 5pm, ends on Sunday 12/2 evening (Time TBD)

## Engagement 5% {#engagement}

It is difficult to explicit codify what constitutes "an engaged student," so 
instead I present the following rough principle I will follow: *you'll only get
out of this class as much as you put in*. Some examples of behavior counter to
this principle:

* Not participating in class.
* Engaging so little with me, either in class or during office hours, that I
don't know what your voice sounds like.
* Shirking group work.
* [Ghosting](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ghosting&utm_source=search-action){target="_blank"}.
* Doing the bare minimum to get by.
