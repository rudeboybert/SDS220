### The data
These data are about the housing market in Texas from the years 2000-2015. Be sure to take a look at the variable descriptions using the ? command and take a View() of the data. 

```{r}
# Load and look at the data 
data(txhousing)
glimpse(txhousing)
```


# Question 1: 
Create a new data frame that does not include the date and inventory variables. We do not need them.  

```{r}

```


# Question 2: 
In January of 2015, what city had the fewest houses listed for sale? 


```{r eval = F}

```


# Question 3: 
A. In 2012, was the total value of sales the largest in the same month in which the most houses sold?


```{r eval = F}

```

```{r eval = F}

```

B. What could you do to take a look at all the rows in these data that had NA values (missing data) for volume?

```{r eval = F}

```


# Question 4:
Generate a single table that shows the total number of houses sold in Austin and Dallas, in 2013 - 2015. This calculation requires a number of steps, so I suggest you write out **pseudocode**, or roughly written code that sets out a "blueprint" of your chain. 

```{r}

```


## Question 5: 
Add a new column to the data that expresses the volume variable in units of $100000. 
```{r}

```


## Question 6: 
A. Make a table that shows the mean percentage of listings that were sold in Dallas in 2015 in each month of the year. 

```{r}

```

B. Extra: Run this little code snip, and study what it does. Can you add the round function to your call above to show the mean percentag of listings with only 2 decimal places?

```{r}
x<- c(0.1234, 0.4795, 0.49736)
round(x, 2)
```


# Question 7: 
What does this code do? A short answer will suffice. 
```{r eval = F}
txhousing %>% 
  arrange(city)
```


# Question 8: 
What does this code do? A short answer will suffice. If the answer is unclear, try changing the city variable to month, or year. 
```{r eval = F}
txhousing %>% 
  distinct(city)
```
