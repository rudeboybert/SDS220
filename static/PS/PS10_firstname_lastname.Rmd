# Background {-}

For this exercise, we will mimic the tactile sampling you did in class with virtual sampling. We will use some data from the [general social survey](http://gss.norc.org/), an annual personal-interview survey conducted in the United States. The survey is designed to monitor changes in both social characteristics and attitudes. 

For this exercise, the "study population" will not be the US population, but rather 2538 individuals living in a single neighborhood whose information are saved in the `gss_cat` data frame in the `forcats` package. As an analogy to the tactile sampling you did in class, the neighborhood is the "bowl" and the 2,538 people are the little balls. We will use sampling to estimate a certain *population proportion* $p$ of interest:

> The proportion of the study population who are divorced

Now you might ask yourself, if we have all 2538 individual's saved in `gss_cat` then why are we sampling to estimate these population proportions $p$? Can't we just compute both population proportions exactly? You are correct! We are only sampling from `gss_cat` as an exercise to study *sampling variation*. In a real life sampling study with a realistic study population, we won't have access to everyone's data!

## Setup

First load the necessary packages:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(forcats)
library(moderndive)
```

Next let's explore the `gss_cat` data set in the `forcats` package using the `glimpse()` function (note that the `forcats` package was loaded automatically with tidyverse). 

```{r}
glimpse(gss_cat)
```

Use the `View()` function **in the console** to take a look at the data in the viewer. And type `?gss_cat` into the console to see a description of the variables in this data set. 

## Exploratory data wrangling

This data set includes many of years of data, and many variables. We will restrict our analysis to only the most recent year (2014), and to only the variable `marital`. 

```{r}
gss_14 <- gss_cat %>% 
  filter(year == 2014) %>% 
  select(marital)
```

You can use the following to see what the different responses were for the marital status question:

```{r}
gss_14  %>% 
  distinct(marital) 
```


# Demo

We are going to use random sampling to estimate the population proportion $p$ of the neighborhood that are divorced. We will start by taking a single virtual random sample of fifty human respondents. Be sure to `View()` the results to get a sense of what our random sample `single_sample_50` looks like.

```{r}
single_sample_50 <- gss_14 %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 1)
```

Next, let's calculate the *sample proportion* $\widehat{p}$ of people who identified themselves as `Divorced` in our single replicate. Recall that the sample proportion $\widehat{p}$ is an "estimate" of the population proportion $p$ who are divorced. This estimate is based on our sample of size n = 50.

```{r}
p_hat <- single_sample_50 %>% 
  summarize(divorced = sum(marital == "Divorced")) %>% 
  mutate(prop_divorced = divorced / 50)
p_hat
```

## a) Sampling a thousand replicates at n = 50

However, we are interested in studying how sampling variation affects our estimates. In other words we want to see how much `p_hat` will vary based on different random samples of size n = 50. In order to study this variation in $\widehat{p}$, we need more than one value of $\widehat{p}$, and hence more than one sample of size n = 50. 

Let's take not 1, but 1000 samples of size n = 50. In other words, 1000 "replicates":

```{r}
sample_n_50_1000_rep <- gss_14 %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 1000)
```

Be sure to `View()` the results `sample_n_50_1000_rep` and scroll down to get a sense of these 1000 replicates look like and how the different replicates are differentiated. Note our sample size is still n = 50 i.e. how many humans are sampled in each replicate; we're just simulating the act of taking many samples of size n = 50:

## b) Calculate sample proportion $\widehat{p}$ for each replicate

We will again calculate the sample proportion $\widehat{p}$ of people who reported they were divorced *for each of the 1000 replicates*:

```{r}
p_hat_n_50_1000_rep <- sample_n_50_1000_rep %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(divorced = sum(marital == "Divorced")) %>% 
  mutate(prop_divorced = divorced / 50)
```

Take a look at the first five rows of the results:

```{r}
p_hat_n_50_1000_rep %>%
  slice(1:5)
```

## c) Visualize the sampling distribution of $\widehat{p}$

We plot the *sampling distribution* of these 1000 simulated values of the sample proportion $\widehat{p}$ of divorced respondents with a histogram

```{r}
ggplot(p_hat_n_50_1000_rep, aes(x = prop_divorced)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, color = "white", fill = "darkgreen") +
  labs(x = "Sample proportion divorced", title = "Sampling distribution of p-hat based on n = 50") 
```

## d) Standard error

Finally we can calculate the standard error, which is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. 

```{r}
p_hat_n_50_1000_rep %>% 
  summarize(SE = sd(prop_divorced))
```

## e) Compare sampling distribution to true population parameter $p$

Let's now calculate the true population proportion $p$ of `Divorced` respondents for the full `gss_14` data set like so. In other words, this would be like doing a *census* and asking everyone in the neighborhood if they are divorced or not.  

```{r}
gss_14 %>% 
  summarize(divorced = sum(marital == "Divorced")) %>% 
  mutate(p_divorced = divorced / nrow(gss_14))
```

**Questions:**

1.  Does it look like our sampling distribution as displayed in the histogram is centered at the true population proportion of `Divorced` respondents for all n=2538 people surveyed? 
1.  Is this what you expected?

**Answers:** 

1.  Yes, the histogram is centered on ~ 0.16.  
1.  I did expect this, since we collected a decently sized sample and ran 1000 reps, and since there is no reason to think that our R sampling is biased.

Now use the `rep_sample_n` function to collect 1000 virtual samples of size n = 15.

1. Let's pretend the GSS organizers can no longer afford to do a **full census** of this neighborhood in the future due to budget cuts. As their stats adviser, what sample size would you recommend they use?


**Answers**:

1. 



# Question 4

Note that in reality, when we are sampling in the real world, we typically only take a **single** sample from the population, due to time or $ constraints. So what do we do to calculate a standard error when we only have a single sample, and not 1000 repeated samples? One method is to use the formula as listed in the Open Intro textbook (Equation from page 124 in OpenIntro 3.1.1):

$SE = \sqrt{p(1-p)/n}$. 

Let's think back to our first `single_sample_50` that we gathered! 

```{r}
single_sample_50 %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

Recall we calculated the population proportion $p$ like so:

```{r}
gss_14 %>% 
  summarize(divorced = sum(marital == "Divorced")) %>% 
  mutate(p_divorced = divorced / nrow(gss_14))
```

Using the equation above, we can calculate a standard error for this **single** sample like so 

```{r}
sqrt(0.16/(1-0.16)/50)
```

This is quite close to the estimate we made earlier from our sampling distribution! Note that when you must calculate a standard error for only a single sample, the formula **contains the sample size, n**. The larger the sample size n, the larger the number in the denominator of this formula. 


**Questions:**

1. How does a larger number in the denominator, i.e. a larger sample size *n* impact the standard error you calculate mathematically?
1. Does this result match what you learned in this exercise from calculating standard errors using the virtual sampling distributions with different sample sizes *n*? Explain.

**Answers:**
