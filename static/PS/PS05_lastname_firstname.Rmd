# Question 1: Ch 6 Learning Checks

You'll be completing slightly modified versions of the Learning Checks from
Chapter 6 of ModernDive. Recall we are using the `evals` dataset with 

* Outcome variable y = teaching score
* Explanatory variable x = age

As a refresher, let's look at a random sample of 5 of 463 professors using
the `sample_n()` command from the `dplyr` package

```{r}
evals %>% 
  sample_n(5)
```


## LC 6.1: EDA

Write the code to perform the following exploratory data analysis:

1. Create a visualization that allows you conduct an "eyeball" test of the
relationship between teaching score and age.
1. Compute a summary statistic of the *strength of linear association* of these
two variables.

```{r}
# 1. Code for visualization:

```

```{r}
# 2. Code for summary statistic:

```

Based on these two outputs, comment on the relationship between teaching score
and instructor age for these 463 instructors at the University of Texas Austin.
Do this in three sentences or less below:




## LC 6.2: Regression table

Do the following in the code block below:

1. Fit the corresponding regression model and save this in `score_model_age`
1. Output the regression table

```{r}
# 1. Fit regression model:

```

```{r}
# 2. Output regression table:

```

**Part a)** What is the numerical value of the intercept? What, according to this model, is the teaching score for teachers with age 0?  Is there any real practical interpretation of the intercept in this case? Note that you can verify these results by comparing them with the visualization above. Write your answer below:

 

**Part b)** What is the slope? On average, how much does teaching score go down each year for a professor? Note that you can verify these results by comparing them with the visualization above. Write your answer below:



**Part c)** Say an a new instructor of age 45 joins the faculty at the UT
Austin. Knowing nothing else about this instructor, what would you predict their
teaching score to be? Show your work:







# Question 2:

Recall the following data/visualization from Question 1 on the [practice
midterm](https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS220/static/exams/Midterm-I_practice.pdf):

```{r}
DD_vs_SB <- read_csv("https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS220/static/PS/DD_vs_SB.csv")

ggplot(DD_vs_SB, aes(x = med_inc, y = shops_per_1000, col = Type)) +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~Type) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, col = "blue") + 
  labs(x = "Median Household Income", y = "# of shops per 1000 people", 
       title = "Coffee/Cafe Comparison in Eastern MA") +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("orange", "forestgreen"))
```

Write the code in the code block below that will allow you to answer the
following two questions:

1. For every increase in $10K in median income, there is an associated **decrease**
of on average how many Dunkin Donuts shops per 1000 individuals?
1. For every increase in $10K in median income, there is an associated **increase**
of on average how many Starbucks per 1000 individuals?

```{r}

```

What are these two values?

1. Value 1:
1. Value 2
