# Load all necessary packages here:
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)

# Load your data, select() only the variables you'll be using in your model, and
# perform all data wrangling here. For example here we load the bechdel data
# set, clean the variable/column names, and select only 
# 1. The variables we are going to use for the regression
# 2. Any identification variables to help disambuguate the rows; in this case
# movie title
library(fivethirtyeight)
bechdel <- bechdel %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  # ID variable, y variable, then any x variables:
  select(title, domgross, year, clean_test)
```



# Introduction

* Discuss the research question you will be addressing with your multiple regression model.
* Talk about your data's context, their sources, and any limitations of the data. 



***



# Exploratory data analysis

* In the code block below
    1. Compute relevant summary statistics and tables
    1. Display informative well-polished visualizations
* Perform all "eye-ball tests" and make preliminary/initial observations here:


```{r}

```




***



# Multiple regression

* Describe in words the components of your multiple regression model. It should
be a single model involving at least one numerical and one categorical
explanatory variable.
* Fit the regression model
* Compute the regression table

```{r}

```

## Statistical interpretation

* Interpret the output of your table using statistical language.
* Tie in the resuts of the table with the results of your exploratory data analysis.
* Discuss (any) potential limitations of your analysis.

## Non-statistical interpretation

* Explain the preliminary results of your model using language meant for a
non-statistically trained audience.



***



# Inference for multiple regression

Note: This section is to be skipped for the initial submission and completed for
the resubmission.

* Interpret:
    1. All confidence intervals emphasizing the "practical significance" of the
    results
    1. All p-values emphasizing the "statisitical significance" of the results
* Get all the regression points and conduct a residual analysis and its
implications for the interpretations.




***



# Conclusion

Note: This section is to be skipped for the initial submission and completed for
the resubmission.

* Summarize your the results of all analysis
* Emphasize the "take-home message" of your analysis
* Discuss all limitations of this analysis and caveats to keep in mind.
* Discuss potential future work.
