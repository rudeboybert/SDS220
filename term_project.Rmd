# 1. Groups due: Fri 2/8 5pm {#groups}

## Action items

1. Form groups of 2-3 students **where all members can attend the same lab section for the labs where you'll be working on your projects (see schedule)**. You do not need to all be *registered* for the same lab section, merely able to all *attend* the same lab.
1. Pick a group name. A prize will be given to the team with my favorite team name!
1. Designate a group leader who will do a little administrative work.

## Items to submit

**Group leader only**:

1. Create two Slack direct messages (DM):
    * One with all your group members + myself + Jenny: <!--Include your group name and--> Say `r emo::ji("wave")` to Jenny and me. Going forward please ask all project related questions here.
    * One with only your group members: Send all private messages amongst yourselves here.
1. Nothing to submit on Moodle this round.
1. Complete the following [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbXQEq00avzSfBC2tCN5SFIEw_MZ2poC0dSpkjVjnr1oKJSw/viewform){target="_blank"}.


**Everybody individually**:

Nothing this time.


## Notes

* If you need a group to join, please Slack me.
* All groups members are expected to contribute and you will all be held accountable for your contributions in peer evaluations.

# 2. Data proposal due: Fri 2/22 5pm {#data} 

## Action items

* Read moderndive for background tools/concepts
    + Chapter 2.4.4 (new) on identification vs measurement variables.
    + Chapter 5.1 on importing spreadsheet data into R.
* Read the [example data proposal](static/term_project/data_proposal_example.html){target="_blank"} written by Jenny and Albert.
* Start working on your data proposal
    + Only if you are not working in RStudio Server on the browser, in other words you are working on RStudio Desktop, ensure you have the `janitor` and `readr` packages installed; they are already installed on RStudio Server.

    + Move it to your `introstatsR` folder where your work is saved.
    + Knit it!
* **This is likely the most time-consuming portion of the entire project, so start early:** Find a dataset that matches the requirements spelled out in the above `data_proposal.Rmd` template R Markdown file. Possible sources:
    1. Your own data from your own projects!
    1. Consult Spinelli Center Data Counselor Vahab Khademi (see syllabus for contact info).
    1. [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch){target="_blank"}
    1. [data.world](https://data.world/){target="_blank"}

## Items to submit

**Group leader only**: On Moodle submit:

1. The `data_proposal.Rmd` R Markdown file
1. The `data_proposal.html` HTML report file
1. Only if you didn't publish your data as a `.csv` on Google Sheets because it has confidential/private information, then include the `.csv` or `.xlsx` spreadsheet file. 


**Everybody individually**:

Nothing this time.


## Notes

* When you have questions:
    + Please ask questions that you think the entire class would like to know the answer to in the `term_project` channel in Slack.
    + Ask more individual questions in the group DM that includes all group members + Jenny + Albert.
* Only minimal data wrangling using the `dplyr` package is expected at this time; you will be doing more for the "project proposal" phase after you're experienced. That being said, feel free to experiment!
* Don't forget to use the tutoring hours: Sun-Thurs 7-9pm in the lecture room.

### 1. log10 transformations

If you have skewed explanatory and/or outcome variables, you should be `log10()`-transforming them and using the transformed variables in your regression and not just visually displaying them with transformed axes. See below:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.height=8/2}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(moderndive)

# log10() transform the skewed variables
house_prices <- house_prices %>%
  mutate(
    log10_price = log10(price),
    log10_size = log10(sqft_living)
  )

# Plot price with re-scaled axes:
ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_log10() + 
  labs(x = "House price (log10-scale)", title = "Seattle house prices") 

# Plot log10-transformed price with regular axes:
ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = log10_price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "log10(House price)", title = "Seattle house prices") 
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8/2, cache=TRUE}
# log10() transformations
house_prices <- house_prices %>%
  mutate(
    log10_price = log10(price),
    log10_size = log10(sqft_living)
  )

p1 <- ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_log10() + 
  labs(x = "House price (log10-scale)", title = "Seattle house prices (log10-scale)") 

p2 <- ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = log10_price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "log10(House price)", title = "Seattle house prices (log10 transformed)") 

p1 + p2
```


### 2. Feedback from previous projects.

1. Jarring hyperlink/code output:
    + In EDA, show a preview of first 6 rows of data using `head()`; this is better than using `glimpse()` as computer code output is jarring to read.
    + Correlations code output is ok, since they donâ€™t take up a lot of space
    + Raw hyperlinks in the body of text or citation section should be converted to text links. See RStudio Menu Bar -> Help -> Markdown Quick Reference -> Links.
1. EDA
    + Make sure you are explicit about what your observational unit is. In other words:
        a) what each row in your dataset represents
        a) what each point in your scatterplots represent
    + Minimize redundancy: Many had a colored scatterplot in Section 2 EDA, then the same plot with fitted lines in Section 3. Put only the latter in Section 2.
    + Main visualization: toy around with using facets. Pick what you think is best and own it.
1. Formatting. Once finished writing your project:
    + Remove any instructions text. Ex: "Discuss the research question you will be addressing with your multiple regression model."
    + Fix typos using the ABC-check button in R Markdown panel (next to magnifying glass buttom).
1. Statistical comments
    + Look at histogram of your numerical variables, in particular the outcome variable. Are they really right skewed? Is a log base 10 (or log base e) transformation worth considering (like in DataCamp or the Seattle House prices example in ModernDive Chapter 12)
    + In all your conclusions, watch out for making statements that too strongly suggest causation (unless you are sure the data was collected in a way that allows for this). Recall that we should set tone to only more conservatively suggest associations. 
1. Non-statistical interpretation:
    + Meant for a non-technical audience
    + Think of this as the overall executive summary, the take-home message meant for a broad audience.
1. Interpretations. Say your categorical explanatory variable has $k$ levels:
    + Instead of intrepreting all intercept/slope coefficients individually, write out fitted regression line equations for $\widehat{y}$ for all $k$ possible levels. Example: if using x = `gender` from evals, write out one equation for male and another for female.
    + ~~Then of your $k$ fitted regression line equations, interpret just the slope coefficient for 2-3 of the resulting equations~~ **Clarifications**: Then of all the rows in your regression table, for 2-3 of them interpret the coefficient estimate and its inferential significance. Try to pick a slope or interaction effect coefficient, since these speak to the relationship between your outcome and explanatory variable. Use your judgement as to which to choose (most interesting, most relevant).


### 3. Evaluation criteria {#evaluationcriteria}

You will be evaluated on the following criteria, which not only emphasizes the data, statistics, and modeling, but also the **communication**, an often neglected criteria:

1. The honor code
    + Your project must adhere to the Smith College Academic Honor Code
    Statement. In particular all external sources must be cited in your
    submissions.
1. The report
    + Is the grammar correct and are there no misspellings? (Click the ABC
    spell-check button to the left of the "Knit" button)
    + Is the writing crisp and concise or is it unnecessarily verbose and wordy? Is the writing clear or is it sloppy?
    + Did you make use of Markdown formatting tools to format the document (bold, italics, url links, etc)?  
    See RStudio Menu Bar -> Help -> Markdown Quick Reference for all formatting options.
    + Is the final project document clean and easy to read?
1. The science and the data
    + Is the data's context/source clearly discussed/given? Recall: *Numbers are numbers, but data
    has context.*
    + Are all limitations and issues with the data addressed?
    + Is the research question of interest clearly stated?   
    + Are the plots/tables polished? Titles, axes labels, legends?
    + Are the plots/tables truly informative or are they included merely for their own sake?
1. The statistics and the analysis
    + Are all statistical/modeling and analyses interpretations valid?
    + Are limitations of the analysis (if any) clearly stated?
    + Are the non-statistical interpretations accessible to an audience not well-versed in statistics?
1. The code
    + Is your code legible and understandable to someone not in your group? Could someone else look at the code in your `.Rmd` file, understand it, and use it for themselves? In other words, is the research easily [reproducible](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970){target="_blank"}?
    + Is your code cleanly formatted? Are you using indentations, spaces, and line breaks effectively?
    + Some examples of good coding style can be found [here](http://style.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"}
1. The rest
    + Did you demonstrate effort and engagement during the semester long process?

# 5. Resubmission due: Thu 5/2 5pm {#resubmission}

## Example

Here is an example resubmission that is subject to a few more cosmetic changes; I will post a final version after the "project submission" round is completed on Fri 4/5.

* <a href="static/term_project/resubmission_example.Rmd" download>`resubmission_example.Rmd`</a> "source code" to create html report output. 
* Resulting [HTML report](static/term_project/resubmission_example.html){target="_blank"} output.



<!--

1. Revise your work based on delivered feedback. 
1. Complete remaining sections.
1. Complete "Inference for multiple regression" and "Conclusion" sections.
    + While you only need to present the results of one model in this term project, in this section make a brief mention why you chose one model over another.
    + Perform a residual analysis.
    + **Added on 12/10**: You do not need to perform any simulations of sampling/bootstrap/null distributions. You only need interpret the p-value and confidence interval columns of your regression table. 
    + **Added on 12/10**: Use R Markdown footnotes for citations. For example, adding `^[Here is an example footnote.]` will add an automatically numbered footnote as seen here^[Here is an example footnote] and here^[Here is another example footnote]. Please use [MLA citation format](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_style_introduction.html){target="_blank"}.
1. Group leader: Once the resubmission is complete
    + Knit `Term_Project.Rmd` one final time.
    + Republish to Rpubs.com
    + **Added on 12/13** Post `Term_Project.Rmd` and all other necessary files on Moddle.
1. **After your group has resubmitted the project** complete this Google Forms [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEmiXTB6qIszAC5r3gLGmDuLQEYvrgRW-bRMezx6te7_7jpQ/viewform){target="_blank"}. 5% of your term project grade is based on completion of this survey.
