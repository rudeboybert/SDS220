## Recap

1. Last time, we did "tactile" simulations with our hands using a shovel with $n$ = 50 slots to extract samples from the bowl.
1. For each sample, you [generated estimates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14iWUKc-lBY8U_hs4Fng50oT43yGQZsgZjrVh7ZtF9VI/edit#gid=0){target="_blank"} of the proportion of the bowl's balls that are red.
1. Note: In ModernDive 7.1, 33 groups of Amherst College students took samples from a bowl with slightly different contents.


## Chalk Talk

1. Chalk talk part I:
    1. Mimic the "tactile sampling using a tactile shovel" from Lec18 on Friday with "virtual sampling using virtual shovel": the `rep_sample_n()` function, which uses your computer's [random number generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation){target="_blank"}.
    1. Example: `rep_sample_n(size = 50, rep = 33)`
1. Reading part I
    1. 7.2 up to the end of 7.2.2
1. Chalk talk part II:
    1. Break down the data wrangling needed to create the data frame visualized in Figure 7.10: Histogram of 1000 proportion reds

# Lec 13: Mon 2/21

## Announcements

1. [Project proposal](project.html) due during lab on Thursday


## Today's Topics/Activities

### 1. Chalk talk

More on regression using a categorical explanatory/predictor variable $x$. Reusing `categ_regression_ex` code example from Lec12:

1. Write out equation for fitted value $\hat{y}$ using indicator functions
1. Computing all fitted values and residuals by hand
1. Re-using code example from Lec12, apply `get_regression_points()` function (additional code is posted below in Lec12)


### 2. In-class exercise

1. Go over ModernDive reading in schedule above, which you need to complete before next lecture.
1. You do not need to submit the answers of all Learning Checks; they are meant for your practice. The solutions to all Learning Checks can be found in Appendix D of ModernDive.


<!--

Recall the `categ_regression_ex` data frame from from Lec11. Note that the explanatory variable $x$ = name is now categorical with 3 levels: Bert, Florence, Katie.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
categ_regression_ex
```

You then plotted the points. Let's also add three lines:

1. A solid line for Bert's "baseline" mean ("Bert" is the baseline because it comes first alphanumerically)
1. A dashed line for Flo's mean, which is *offset* from Bert's mean by 12 - 10 = +2
1. A dotted line for Ivy's mean, which is *offset* from Bert's mean by 9 - 10 = -1

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = categ_regression_ex, mapping = aes(x=name,y=value)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 10) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 12, linetype = "longdash") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 9, linetype = "dotted")
```

Then write on board (in order to bridge the gap between output of regression
table & wacked out indicator function notation they'll read in Chapter 5.2.2
today):

1. Make a separate table of name on rows, and nameFlorence and nameKatie in columns, populate with 0's & 1's
1. Write out equation of "line" in terms of regression table output:
    + `value = intercept + nameFlorence + nameKatie`.
    + Do all three cases
1. Write out equation of line via math and with indicator functions:
    + Explain what indicator function is $1_{Florence}(x)$
    + $\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_{Florence}\cdot 1_{Florence}(x) + b_{Katie}\cdot 1_{Katie}(x)$
    + We need this notation in particular for multiple regression in Chapter 6


Let's now get the fitted values and residuals using the `get_regression_points()` function on `model_ex` (where our model is saved):

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Step 2: Get regression points
get_regression_points(model_ex)
```

Then write on board:

1. When x is categorical y-hat fitted values correspond to group means for each level:
    + Bert: Just 10
    + Florence: 10 + 2 = 12
    + Katie: 10 - 1 = 9
1. Compute a few residuals and show they correspond to deviations/errors from the group means

Note for future self: Make sure to talk about interpretation of the values in estimate column of table in context of example.

Note for future self:
- x numerical: for every slide of 1 in x, the slope is the expected/on average change in y (not necessarialy causal)
- x categorical: for a hop between categories starting from the baseline

If mental bandwidth exists, add to ModernDive -> Chapter 5.2.2 -> a visualization of what the terms in the regression table in Table 5.8 actually mean. Do this in [moderndive_book](https://github.com/moderndive/ModernDive_book/) repo -> `bert-dev` branch -> Open `05-regression.Rmd` and edit, commit, and push this file only. The book builds and deploys automatically using Netlify

* A jitterplot of x = continent, y = lifeExp, mark baseline, mark means, show offsets of marked means vs baseline.
* Insert in text right before "Let’s generalize this idea a bit".

1. See Slack `#general`: Newest SDS faculty Shiya Cao visit today


## Today's Topics/Activities

### 1. Chalk talk

1. Lec 11 in-class exercise: sum of squared residuals computation of dashed black line
1. Regression with a categorical predictor variable. Copy the following code into your `classnotes.Rmd` that creates a data frame called `categ_regression_ex`
with 9 rows and 2 variables:
    1. A numerical outcome variable $y$ = `value`
    1. An *categorical* explanatory variable $x$ = `name` with 3 levels: Bert, Flo, Ivy.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(moderndive)
categ_regression_ex <- tibble(
  name = c("Bert", "Bert", "Bert", "Flo", "Flo", "Flo", "Ivy", "Ivy", "Ivy"),
  value = c(9, 10, 11, 11, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10)
)
categ_regression_ex

# Code we typed during Lec12 to view regression table:
# Step 1: Fit and save model
categ_model <- lm(value ~ name, data = categ_regression_ex)
# Step 2: Output regression table
get_regression_table(categ_model)

# Code we typed during Lec13 to view information on all 9 points
# where:
# value = y outcome variable
# name = x explanatory variable (categorical)
# value_yat = y_hat fitted values (group/category means)
# residual = y - y_hat errors
get_regression_points(categ_model)
```

1. Correlation is not necessarily causation:
    a) [Spurious correlations](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations){target="_blank"}
    a) What are X = treatment, Y = response, and Z = confounding variables?
    a) What are causal graphs?

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
simple_regression_ex
```
    a) Draw the 3 points and the "best-fitting" regression line in blue.
    a) Draw the 3 *fitted values* $\widehat{y}$ using the equation for the regression line $\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1\cdot x$
    a) Draw the 3 *residuals* $y - \widehat{y}$
    a) Compute the sum of squared residuals for this line.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(simple_regression_ex, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, size = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 2, slope = -1, col = "darkgreen", linetype = "dashed", size = 0.5) +

Consider the following 3 points saved in a data frame called `simple_regression_ex`. 
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
simple_regression_ex
```

We display the *regression table*. This is done in two steps:
```{r, eval = TRUE}
# Step 1: Fit regression model
model_ex <- lm(y ~ x, data = simple_regression_ex)

# Step 2: Get regression table
get_regression_table(model_ex)
```

<!--
* Connection between regression line and values in `estimate` column of regression table.
* Interpretation of:
    + Fitted intercept $b_0$: mathematical versus practical interpretations.
    + Fitted slope $b_1$: precise language matters!
* Obtaining a regression table takes two steps:
    + Create/fit the model using `lm()` and formula interface `y ~ x`
    + Ask for the table using `get_regression_table()` function from `moderndive` package

Notes on precise interpretation of fitted slope b1: For every increase of one
unit in x, it is the associated average increase in y.

* average b/c not all differences of one unit in x have exactly b1 increase in y,
rather averaged across all differences of unit in x
* associated b/c we don't want to assume a casual relationship

## Recap

![](static/images/toolbox.jpeg){ width=50% }

Our data wrangling toolbox, which you will use for your project and for the rest of this course:

1. `filter()` rows
1. `summarize()` rows using a summary function
1. `group_by()` to group rows by the values of another variable
1. `mutate()` new variables/columns
1. `arrange()` rows in ascending (default) or `desc()`ending order
1. `select()` variables/columns
1. For more verbs, see `dplyr` cheatsheet: Go to RStudio menu bar -> Help -> Cheatsheets -> Data Transformation with `dplyr`.


Students get tripped up with difference between filter() and summarize(). The
former does not modify original rows, whereas the latter creates new ones that
are based on summary statistics.


Next time 220 is taught: At this point in semester (Lec08-09) since students have a little context, consider doing a review of coding/computing concepts needed for this course:

- R console vs R Markdown are two different environments. i.e. when you create a variable/load a package in one, it doesn't necessarily exist in the other.
- Tackling error messages. Perhaps have a problem set where the students read error message and write down what the message is saying.
- Paired programming exercise: One student only writes, the other only asks questions.
- When getting help, steer students away from saying "This doesn't work" but rather "I did X. I got result Y. I think Z." That way we get what they're thinking better: building up to the idea of a minimally reproducible example.

## Today's Topics/Activities

### 1. Chalk talk

Using same `fruit_basket` example from chalk talk in Lec 07:  

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
fruit_basket
```

1. "Summary functions" are many-to-one functions to compute "summary statistics," like `mean()` & `median()`
1. Using summary functions to then `summarize()` rows
1. Setting "group meta-data" of a data frame using `group_by()`, then `summarize()` rows. In other words, `group_by()` by itself does not change the "data", rather only the "meta-data"
1. `mutate()` new variables from existing variables: price in cents

<!--
**Posted after lecture**: In case you want to run the chalk talk example on your
computer:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create fruit_basket data frame from scratch
# (we won't do this much in this class)
library(tibble)
fruit_basket <- tibble(
  type = c("mango", "kiwi", "mango", "grape", "grape", "mango"),
  price = c(2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3)
)

# Calculate average cost of all fruit:
library(dplyr)
avg_price_all_fruit <- fruit_basket %>% 
  summarize(mean_price = mean(price))
avg_price_all_fruit

# Calculate average cost of each fruit:
avg_price_each_fruit <- fruit_basket %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  summarize(mean_price = mean(price))
avg_price_each_fruit

# Calculate cost of each fruit in cents:
fruit_basket_cents <- fruit_basket %>% 
  mutate(price_cents = price * 100)
fruit_basket_cents
```

# Lec 07: Mon 2/7

## Announcements

* Copy the following code in a new R code chunk in your `classnotes.Rmd` file
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    library(readr)
    library(dplyr)
    library(ggplot2)
    africa <- read_csv("https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS220/static/africa_results_2022.csv")
    
    # Look at variable types
    glimpse(africa)

      geom_histogram()
    
    # 3. Boxplot
    ggplot(data = africa, mapping = aes(x = group, y = countries_in_africa)) +
      geom_boxplot()
    ```


## Today's Topics/Activities

### 1. Chalk talk

1. Finish data visualization
    + Recap 3 data visualizations 
    + Note about boxplots: width/height of the box = IQR = measure of spread
    + How to add labels to a `ggplot()` with `labs()`
1. Data wrangling
    1. Define the "pipe operator" `%>%`, pronounced *then*
    1. Logical AKA boolean operators in computer programming
    1. `filter()` rows that match a criteria
    1. Example data frame we'll use is `fruit_basket`

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
fruit_basket
```

**Posted after lecture**: In case you want to run the chalk talk example on your
computer:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create fruit_basket data frame from scratch
# (we won't do this much in this class)
library(tibble)
fruit_basket <- tibble(
  type = c("mango", "kiwi", "mango", "grape", "grape", "mango"),
  price = c(2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3)
)

# Filter the basket only for grapes
library(dplyr)
grape_basket <- fruit_basket %>% 
  filter(type == "grape")

# View contents of grapes
grape_basket
```

<!--
First, let's compare the boxplot you created in Lec04 with the original points. See how they align.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
plot1 <- ggplot(example, aes(x=factor(1), y=values)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Points") +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  )

plot2 <- ggplot(example, aes(x=factor(1), y=values)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot") +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  )
plot1 + plot2
```

Second, let's compare two visualizations of the distribution of the numerical variable temperature *split by* month:

* Faceted histogram in ModernDive [Figure 2.13](https://moderndive-bert.netlify.com/2-viz.html#facets){target="_blank"}
* Side-by-side boxplot in ModernDive [Figure 2.18](https://moderndive-bert.netlify.com/2-viz.html#boxplots){target="_blank"}

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = "white") +
  facet_wrap(~ month)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = factor(month), y = temp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Which do you prefer?

example <- tibble(
  values = c(1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 30)

We want to visualize the distribution of the following `r nrow(example)` values with a boxplot: `r example %>% pull(values)`. They have the following *summary statistics* (a single numerical value *summarizing* many values):

1. Quartiles (1st, 2nd, and 3rd) that cut up the data into 4 parts, each containing roughly one quarter = 25% of the data:
    a) 1st quartile: `r quantile(example$values, probs=0.25, type = 2)`
    a) 2nd quartile = median: `r median(example$values)`
    a) 3rd quartiles: `r quantile(example$values, probs=0.75, type=2)`
1. Interquartile-range (IQR): the distance between the 3rd and 1st quartiles:
    a) 8 = 13.5 - 5.5
