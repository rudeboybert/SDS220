# Lec 9

## Announcements

* Albert extra office hours Thursday 2-4pm in McConnell 215.
* Project proposal [submission format](term_project.html#submission_format) added. Just follow along and replace my example with your work!
* Solutions to PS02 [posted](#PS02_R_solutions)
    + Please download the `PS02_solutions.R` file to your computer and open them in RStudio for a brief in-class discussion.
    + To guarantee the `PS02_solutions.R` file opens in the RStudio app (AKA a car's dashboard) and not the regular R app (AKA a car's engine), don't double-click the `PS02_solutions.R` file directly, but rather go to Files panel of RStudio and find/click/open the file from there.

    
## Today's Topics/Activities  

### 1. Midterm I Practice Questions Discussion

**Note about Question 4.b)** Both the following plots show the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita in 2007 in the `gapminder` data, but the right one has GDP per capita (USD) on the x-axis on a $\log10$-scale using `scale_x_log10()`. Thus:

* Left plot: the white grid lines on the x-axis denote **additive** differences of $+10000$ 
* Right plot: the white grid lines on the x-axis denote **multiplicative** differences of $\times 10$

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 7/2, eval =TRUE, cache = TRUE}
gapminder2007 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007)

# Simple plot -------------------------------------------------------------
base <- ggplot(gapminder2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, col = continent, size = pop)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(
    y = "Life expectancy (years)", 
    color = "Continent", size = "Population"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position="none", panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
  
p1 <- base +
  labs(x = "GDP per capita", title = "Regular scale x-axis") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format())
p2 <- base +
  labs(x = "GDP per capita (log10-scale)", title = "log10 scale x-axis") + 
  scale_x_log10(breaks = c(100, 1000, 10000, 100000), limits = c(NA, 10^5), labels = scales::dollar_format())
p1 + p2
```


**Note about Question 5.f)** Counterexample. Both these datasets have 11 values and the same quartiles as Nashville (32K, 60K, and 100K), but have different proportions greater than 80K:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
data_frame(
  data1 = c(16, 17, 32, 33, 54, 60, 61, 62, NA, NA, 100, 110, 115),
  data2 = c(16, 17, 32, 33, 54, 60, NA, NA, 98, 99, 100, 110, 115)
) %>% 
  t() %>% kable()
```

| Dataset    |   |   |  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  |    |    |
|:-----|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|---:|---:|---:|
|Data 1 | 16| 17| **32** | 33| 54| **60**| 61| 62| | | **100**| 110| 115|
|Data 2 | 16| 17| **32** | 33| 54| **60**| | | 98| 99| **100**| 110| 115|


### 2. Chalk Talk

**a) Summarizing**: Note "summarise" is the British English spelling of the American English "summarize". Both `summarise()` and `summarize()` work in R. 

| Use any summary function | To `summarize()` data
|:-------------------------|:-------------------------
| ![](https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive_book/raw/master/images/summary.png){ width=400px } | ![](https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive_book/raw/master/images/summarize1.png){ width=400px }


**b) Grouping then summarizing**: First `group_by()` to group rows together (the grey, blue, green color assignment) then `summarize()` to get group-by-group summaries (a summary statistic for each color).

# Problem set 3 {#PS03}

*Assigned Wednesday 9/26, due Wednesday 10/3 at 1pm Eastern Time*

## 1. DataCamp

No DataCamp this week.


## 2. R component {#PS03_R}

Read the following Chance Magazine article [Looking Good on Course Evaluations](http://chance.amstat.org/2013/04/looking-good/){target="_blank"} up to and including Table 1. In particular, note the introductory paragraph:

> At the end of each semester, students provide feedback on their courses via anonymous course evaluations. However, use of student evaluations as indicators of quality of the course and teaching effectiveness is often criticized since these measures may be reflecting biases in favor of nonteaching-related characteristics, such as the physical appearance of the instructor.

You'll be analyzing the same data used in this study. The data is in the `evals` data frame, which is included in the `moderndive` R package. A larger goal of this problem set is to start practicing answering questions with data visualizations

* Download the following R scratchpad: <a href="static/PS/PS03_lastname_firstname.R" download>`PS03_lastname_firstname.R`</a> and rename it so that it matches your name. For example in my case: `PS03_Kim_Albert.R`.
* Open `PS03_lastname_firstname.R` and follow the indicated steps. I *highly* recommend you copy and paste existing code from ModernDive and then tweak it to achieve your goal.
* When you are finished, check that your code is *reproducible and replicable*. Meaning if you were to send someone else this file and they ran the code, woult they get the same results as you?
    + Save your work. The filename `PS03_lastname_firstname.R` should change from red to black.
    + Close `PS03_lastname_firstname.R`.
    + Restart R: RStudio menu bar -> Session -> Restart R. This "reboots R" by deleting all previously saved data frames and shuts down all loaded packages.
    + Go to the Files panel of RStudio and re-open `PS03_lastname_firstname.R`.
    + Re-run all your code to make sure that you can replicate all images.
* **Submission**: Submit this on [Moodle](https://moodle.smith.edu/course/view.php?id=30498){target="_blank"}. 
* See [syllabus](syllabus.html#evaluation-expectations) for expectations on R component submissions.


**Hints**:

* Everything you need to know for this problem set are based on Lectures 1-7 in particular the ModernDive readings.
* While I encourage you collaborate/help each other out, please make an honest effort to do this problem set. This is practice for the final project

# Lec 8

## Announcements

* Lecture on today will start at 1:20pm to give people time to comfortably get from Emily Dodwell's talk listed in [Lec06](#Lec06).
* Visitor: [Data Counselor Raul Zelada Aprili](https://www.smith.edu/qlc/tutoring.html?colDataCnslr=open#PanelDataCnslr){target="_blank"}
* Submission format for Term Project Proposal on Wednesday.
* Lab tomorrow/Thursday
    + Jenny will go over a [data viz recap lab](static/data_vis_lab/lab4_source_JS_SDS220b.html){target="_blank"} which will be helpful for Midterm I studying.
    + After that you can work on Problem Sets.
    + However you allocate your time, Jenny and I ask you stay until the end of lab period as getting up and leaving is very disruptive. For example, we suggest you do exercises in [DataCamp Practice Mode](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/introducing-daily-practice-mode){target="_blank"} to reinforce what you've already learned!
        
        
## Midterm I

* Administrative:
    + If you have never taken a Self-Scheduled exam, please read the instructions [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10mkwAnJVTbOiz_g-bUDrrUL_S-6j-8ul/view){target="_blank"}
    + Available Friday 9/29 5pm through Sunday 9/30 ~9pm~ 11:55pm.
   You must submit your midterm by 11:55pm on Sunday.  + You will be given 120 mins to complete it (including transit time to writing area), however I try to time it so that it will take much less than that. In other words, you should have plenty of time to complete it without rushing.
    + Closed-book, no internet, and individually completed.
    + Topics: Lectures 1-7. In other words everything up to and including data visualizations
    + Please bring colored pens
* What to study:
    + Before Wednesday's lecture, do the practice midterm questions.
    + Your hand-written course notes first: they are the "executive summaries" of topics.
    + The material on the course webpage chronologically, in particular the ModernDive readings.
    + You will not write code for the midterm, but you may need to understand code.
    + No questions from DataCamp will be asked.
* Practice midterm questions [PDF](static/exams/Midterm-I_practice.pdf){target="_blank"}. I **do not** have a PDF of solutions, we'll cover these in class on Wednesday. Note this is a compilation of a few midterms, so its length is longer than what you can expect on the midterm. Do the following questions:
    + Q1 Short Answer - Part b)
    + Q4 Gapminder - All parts. Hint for Part b): Read ModernDive Chapter 12.1.2 on log10-transformations
    + Q5 Family income by city - All parts.
    + Q1 America Runs on Starbucks: Parts a) and c)
* Extra help:
    + Jenny office hours, still lots of Wednesday slots! [Book here](https://jennysmetzer.youcanbook.me/){target="_blank"}.
    + Albert extra office hours Thursday 2-4pm in McConnell 215.

# Lec 6 {#Lec06}

## Announcements

* Curious about a career in data science? Then come for Emily Dodwell (class of 2011)'s talk "The Nuts and Bolts of a Data Science Career" on Monday 9/24; stay for the `r emo::ji("pizza")` lunch! Click [here](static/dodwell_talk.pdf){target="_blank"} for flyer.
* Problem set 2 posted [below](#PS02).
* Upcoming "Important dates" in schedule above:

    + Self-scheduled Midterm I weekend of Friday 9/28
* Learning check solutions by Friday, I promise!
* Slack poll on `scratchpad.R`


## RStudio Desktop

In this week's lab sections you’ll get help installing R + RStudio on your computers; the instructions are in ModernDive 2.1.1. **Starting on Friday I will assume you are all using the desktop version of RStudio.** If you're still curious about RStudio Server & RStudio Cloud, check out these [notes](notes.html#server_cloud).

So after Friday you'll be responsible for installing R Packages as described in ModernDive 2.3. In other words, to use a package for the first time:

1. You'll need to install it once.
1. *Load/open* it using `library()` command. Ex: `library(nycflights13)`



## Today's Topics/Activities       

### 1. Chalk Talk: Histograms "binning" structure

Comparing Figures 3.10 and 3.11 in the ModernDive readings from Lec 5

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(nycflights13)
# Code to generate Fig 3.10 with bar border color white
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white")
# Code to generate Fig 3.11
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 60, color = "white")
```
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(nycflights13)
library(patchwork)
# Code to generate Fig 3.10
p1 <- ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Fig 3.10: 30 bins")
# Code to generate Fig 3.11
p2 <- ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 60, color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Fig 3.11: 60 bins")
p1 + p2
```


### 2. Chalk Talk: Boxplots

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
example <- data_frame(
  values = c(1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 30)
)
```

Say we want to plot a boxplot of the following `r nrow(example)` values which are pre-sorted: 

> `r example %>% pull(values)`

They have the following *summary statistics*:


Min. | 1st Qu. | Median  | 3rd Qu.  |  Max. 
---- | ------- | ------  |  ------- | --- 
`r min(example$values)`  |  `r quantile(example$values, probs=0.25, type = 2)` |  `r median(example$values)`  |  `r quantile(example$values, probs=0.75, type=2)`  | `r max(example$values)`


Let's compare the points and the corresponding boxplot side-by-side with the values on the $y$-axis matching:

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
plot1 <- ggplot(example, aes(x=factor(1), y=values)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Points") +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  )

plot2 <- ggplot(example, aes(x=factor(1), y=values)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot") +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  )
plot1 + plot2
```

## Today's Topics/Activities       

### 1. Chalk Talk

* Histograms visualize the *(empirical) distribution* of a numerical variable
* Facets + Histograms: Allow you to visualize *the conditional distribution* of a numerical variable

### 2. In-class exercise: Comment lines

In the screen shot of my `scratchpad.R` above, any line that starts with a `#` are called *comment lines*. They are ignored by R when you run them in the console. Run both these lines in the console separately:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
this is a comment line that R ignores that helps readers (including you!) understand code

# this is a comment line that R ignores that helps readers (including you!) understand code
```

Why does one line return an `Error` whereas the other doesn't?

# Problem set 2 {#PS02}

*Assigned Wednesday 9/19, due Wednesday 9/26 at 1pm Eastern Time*

## 1. DataCamp

* Complete the "Introduction to the Tidyverse" course, which you should see [here](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse){target="_blank"}.
* Note: DataCamp does things in a slightly order, data wrangling first then data visualization. ModernDive however does data visualization first in Chapter 3 then data wrangling in Chapter 5. Reading ModernDive Chapter 5 is not a pre-requisite for completing this problem set.
* See the [syllabus](syllabus.html#evaluation-expectations) for expectations on DataCamp assignments.
* If you have already completed the "Introduction to the Tidyverse" DataCamp course previously using a DataCamp account based on your Smith email, you do not need to re-do them; they will show up in my logs as completed.

## 2. R component {#PS02_R}

Read the following 538 article [Higher Rates Of Hate Crimes Are Tied To Income Inequality](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/higher-rates-of-hate-crimes-are-tied-to-income-inequality/){target="_blank"}. You'll be analyzing the same data used to write this article. The data is in the `hate_crimes` dataframe, which is included in the `fivethirtyeight` R package. A larger goal of this problem set is to start practicing the "data analysis" workflow.

* Download the following R scratchpad: <a href="static/PS/PS02_lastname_firstname.R" download>`PS02_lastname_firstname.R`</a> and rename it so that it matches your name. For example in my case: `PS02_Kim_Albert.R`.
* "Upload" this file to RStudio Server by going to RStudio -> Files panel -> Upload.
* Open `PS02_lastname_firstname.R` and follow the indicated steps. I *highly* recommend you copy and paste existing code from ModernDive and then tweak it to achieve your goal.
* When you are finished, check that your code is *reproducible and replicable*. Meaning if you were to send someone else this file and they ran the code, woult they get the same results as you?
    + Save your work and close `PS02_lastname_firstname.R`.
    + Restart R: RStudio menu bar -> Session -> Restart R. This "reboots R" by deleting all previously saved data frames and shuts down all loaded packages.
    + Go to the Files panel of RStudio and re-open `PS02_lastname_firstname.R`.
    + Run all your code as described in [Lec4](#Lec04) and make sure that you can replicate the scatterplot.
* **Submission**: ~~Download this file on to your compter by going to RStudio -> Files panel -> More -> Export.~~  (9/20 10am update: I just crossed out the outdated instructions assuming you were working on RStudio Server. Since we are now assuming RStudio Desktop, the `PS02_lastname_firstname.R` file should exist on your computer) Submit this`PS02_lastname_firstname.R`[Moodle](https://moodle.smith.edu/course/view.php?id=30498){target="_blank"}. 
* See [syllabus](syllabus.html#evaluation-expectations) for expectations on R component submissions.

**Hints**:

* Everything you need to know for this problem set are based on Lectures 1-4, in particular the ModernDive readings.
* While I encourage you collaborate/help each other out, please make an honest effort to do this problem set. Part of the graders' and my goal in grading the problem sets is to identify both your **strengths and weaknesses** in preparation for the projects. Don't forget the lowest two problem set scores are dropped!

## Announcements

* **Extra office hours today 3:30-5pm in McConnell 215**
* For those of you with interests in Biology: Reed College's Prof Derek Applewhite ["The Spatial and Temporal Regulation of Non-muscle Myosin II Contractility"](https://twitter.com/rudeboybert/status/1040272556991959041){target="_blank"} talk on Monday afternoon.
* Syllabus:
    + Added expectations to [Basic Information](syllabus.html#basicinfo) section.
    + Added note about when to do DataCamp courses to [syllabus](syllabus.html#datacamp): *You do not need to complete any DataCamp courses in preparation for future lectures; they will always be explicitly assigned and you will subsequently be given time during Tu/Th lab sections to do them.*
* Solutions to previous lecture's learning checks will be posted directly underneith question. Ex: Look at [LC2.1 Solutions](https://moderndive.netlify.com/2-getting-started.html#exploredataframes){target="_blank"} I just posted.


## Today's Topics/Activities       

### 1. Chalk Talk

The Grammar of Graphics: the theoretical underpinnings of statistical graphics.

### 2. In-class exercise: R code scratchpads

**Question**: Should I be copying/pasting/tweeking code directly in the console window?  
**Answer**: You can, but it makes saving work difficult. Instead, create a "scratchpad":

1. Create a new `.R` script: In RStudio Menu Bar -> File -> New File -> R Script. 
1. Save this as `scratchpad.R`
1. Copy/paste/tweak any code in your scratchpad, not in console window. For example, for this exercise write: `1+1`
1. To "run" code in the console (in other words tell R to "do this"), you can do one of the following:
    1. Copy it from scratchpad, then paste it in console, then hit enter.
    1. Highlight the code you want to run, then click on "Run"
    1. Highlight the code you want to run, then press control+enter on Windows/Unix/Chromebook or ⌘+enter on macOS.
1. Save and close the file.
1. In the Files panel, click on `scratchpad.R` to reopen your previously saved work.

### 3. In-class exercise: ModernDive

As marked in the Schedule at the top of this page, read ModernDive 3-3.3.1 (start of Chapter 3 to the end of 3.3.1).

* Do not ignore the "Needed Packages" section at the beginning. Recall:
    + The phone vs app analogy described in ModernDive 2.3.
    + If you are using RStudio Server in your browser, these packages come pre-installed.
    + If you are using RStudio Desktop installed on your computer, you'll have to ensure these packages are installed.
* Please skip the "Introduction to the Tidyverse" DataCamp course mentioned at the beginning of Chapter 3 for now.
* "Learning checks": These are practice problems that you do not need to submit. Should you write your answers down? If you feel like you would benefit, then yes! I will post solutions to the learning checks before the next lecture!
* **Note**: In this class, of the "Five Named Graphs" described in ModernDive 3.2, we'll only cover scatterplots, histographs, and boxplots; we'll be skipping linegraphs and barplots.

## Getting help

A big part of learning data science tools is learning how to get help effectively. For example, in this course:

**In class**:

1. Ask yourself "Is this something I can Google?" Learning to use Google effectively is an important tool in a data scientist's toolbox.
1. Ask the people sitting next to you. 
1. Raise your hand to ask the data assistant or myself.

**Outside of class**:

1. Ask yourself "Is this something I can Google?" Learning to use Google effectively is an important tool in a data scientist's toolbox.
1. Ask yourself "Are there people I work with in class that I can Slack?"
1. If you all don't know, post a question on Slack in the `#r_questions` channel.
1. Visit the Spinelli Center for tutoring Sunday-Thursday 7-9pm (see [syllabus](syllabus.html#basicinfo) for more info).
