* Syllabus: Added *expectations* to "basic information" section.
* "Should I be copy/paste/tweeking code directly in the console?" Topic for today: `.R` script files AKA "scratchpads"

## Today's Activity

The Grammar of Graphics


***



# Lec 3

* Go over previous Slack `#general_announcements`
* If you haven't already, **please** complete the [Intro Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd7Ozr9tVcHG9Ho9ijEjQZjncLSLD5pYYfKjURbWIrIrvbDPg/viewform){target="_blank"} from Lec 1.
* Self-scheduled Midterm II has been moved from Fri 10/26 thru Sun 10/28 to Fri 11/2 thru Sun 11/4 because of family weekend. 
* Syllabus discussion:
    + Added full topic schedule
    + Added office hours
    + Added *expectations* to following sections:
        1. Topic Schedule and Readings
        1. Evaluation
        1. Accommodations
        1. Code of Conduct
* **Extra office hours: Friday 9/14, 3:30-5pm in McConnell 215**

## Today's Activity       
        
1. Go over ModernDive Chapter 2. Note:
    + You can skip all videos and linked DataCamp courses.
    + "Learning checks": These are practice problems that you do not need to submit. Should you write your answers down? If you feel like you would benefit, then yes! I will post solutions to the learning checks before the next lecture!

## Getting help

A big part of learning data science tools is learning how to get help effectively. For example, in this course:

**In class**:

1. Ask yourself "Is this something I can Google?" Learning to use Google effectively is an important tool in a data scientist's toolbox.
1. Ask the people sitting next to you. 
1. Raise your hand to ask the data assistant or myself.

**Outside of class**:

1. Ask yourself "Is this something I can Google?" Learning to use Google effectively is an important tool in a data scientist's toolbox.
1. Ask yourself "Are there people I work with in class that I can Slack?"
1. If you all don't know, post a question on Slack in the `#r_questions` channel.
1. Visit the Spinelli Center for tutoring Sunday-Thursday 7-9pm (see [syllabus](syllabus.html#basicinfo) for more info).

# Problem set 1 {#PS01}

*Assigned Wednesday 9/12, due Wednesday 9/19 at 1pm*

1. **DataCamp**
    * Complete the following chapters from the "Introduction to R" course, which you should see in the following [link](https://www.datacamp.com/enterprise/2018-09-sds220-intro-to-probability-statistics/assignments){target="_blank"}:
        * Chapter 1: "Intro to basics"
        * Chapter 2: "Vectors"
        * Chapter 4: "Factors"
        * Chapter 5: "Data Frames"
    * Expectations about DataCamp assignments have been posted in the [syllabus](syllabus.html#datacamp)
1. **Administrative stuff**: To receive full credit for this portion simply ensure
    * Slack:
        1. Your full name is listed: full name = how you would like to be addressed in class & last name.  
        1. You have added a profile picture with your face visible. This will help me learn your names.
        1. Hint: Start relying on Google! "How do I change my name and profile picture on Slack?"
        1. You are a member of the `#moderndive_typoes`, `#r_questions`, and `random` channels.
    * DataCamp: Your full name is listed in your [profile](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/account_settings){target="_blank"}; the rest is optional.

# Lec 2

1. **Slack**
    + I've separated our class Slack team from the previous one. Please join the new one by clicking [here](https://join.slack.com/t/sds-mth-220-fall2018/shared_invite/enQtNDMxNjc2ODM2Njg4LWQ1ODY3NDNiYTYzYTU5NTA2YWRlODkwNThhZDE4MjQwMjk1NzZlYmYxYjU4ZjI4N2MxNWVhYjg3NjEzYzk4YjY){target="_blank"}.
    + Practice sending [formated messages](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages){target="_blank"} to a classmate.
1. **Getting started with data in R**
    + Click "R" in the menu bar above to open RStudio Server to use R in your web-browser.
    + Click on ModernDive above and read Chapter 2: Getting started with data.
        + You don't need to watch the videos for now
        + If you are using RStudio Server, you don't need to install packages. However, you will need to load them.
        + Learning checks: These are practice problems to reinforce your learning. You do not need to submit today's learning checks.
1. **Lab Tuesday/Thursday** Start the DataCamp portion of [Problem set 1](#PS01). Jenny will help you get used to the DataCamp interface.

# Lec 1

* What is inference demo.
* From the ModernDive [Introduction for Students](https://moderndive.netlify.com/index.html#sec:intro-for-students){target="_blank"}: ![](https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive_book/raw/master/images/flowcharts/flowchart/flowchart.002.png){ width=600px }
* It all builds up to the `infer` package for "tidy" statistical inference. Only if you're curious:
  + [Package homepage](http://infer.netlify.com/){target="_blank"}
  + [High-level talk of package](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/infer-a-package-for-tidy-statistical-inference/){target="_blank"}.
