<p>Everything in this course builds up to the group project, where there is only one learning goal: <em>Engage in the data/science research pipeline in as faithful a manner as possible while maintaining a level suitable for novices.</em></p>
<center>
<img src="static/images/pipeline.png" width="600" />
</center>
<p></br></p>
<p>In order to break down the task and minimize end-of-semester stress, you’ll be working on the project in four phases:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Project data: Propose a data set for your project. This is the phase of the project that is the least straightforward. Thus, we recommend you start early and get help during the various 220 office hours posted on Moodle early and often.</li>
<li>Project proposal: Ensure you can work with your data in R by performing an exploratory data analysis. This phase may require revisions to your original choice of data and visits to the Spinelli tutoring center for help with data wrangling.</li>
<li>Project submission: Make an initial submission of your project. You will skip some of the sections for now and only complete them after we have covered inference for regression in class. After you submit your work, you will get instructor feedback.</li>
<li>Project resubmission: Incorporate your instructor feedback from the project submission phase, complete the remaining sections, and resubmit your project. You will only be graded on your project resubmission.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<div id="data" class="section level1">
<h1>1. Project Data</h1>
<!--
Notes to future self: 

* Forming groups
    + ABSOLUTELY SPLIT the "form groups" and "find data" phases into two parts. 
    Assigning them at the same time causes the following problem: we don't
    know which individuals need a group until really late, leaving not much time to
    find data. Split the "form groups" into it's own phase, and do this early.
    + Stretch goal: Instead of assigning groups at random to people who need them,
    IF you have the mental bandwidth, use a blocked randomization scheme. For ex: by
    major or some interest (sports team, hometown, etc). That way there will be less
    potential for disagreement over what dataset to use, which Adriana B. pointed
    out happened in her 192 mini-project 3.
* Finding data: Students have NO CLUE how to search for data and we suffer from curse of 
knowledge. So next time
    + Have the Data Counselor comes to a lab and live-demo finding data.
    + As a problem set/lab, have students each find their own dataset with minimal
    restrictions (which they can later bring to table for data collection phase).
    Put it on a Google Sheet so that everyone finds a dataset. And add "why do you
    think it's interesting"
-->
<div id="form-groups" class="section level2">
<h2>Form groups</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Form groups of 2-3 students.
<ul>
<li>You <strong>must</strong> all be registered for the same lab section, because certain labs will be devoted to working on the project.</li>
<li>All groups members are expected to contribute and you will all be held accountable for your contributions in peer evaluations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Choose a group name.</li>
<li>Assign a “team/group leader” role for each of the four phases of this project to everyone in your team at least once. The team/group leader will have extra administrative duties at each phase. Ex: making Moodle submissions, filling out Google Forms, etc.</li>
<li>The team leader for this first “Project Data” phase will then:
<ul>
<li>Create a Slack direct message (DM) that includes all 1) your group members, 2) your instructor, and 3) your lab instructor. Ask all questions relating to your specific project here. That way everyone is on the same page.</li>
<li>Submit your group information using the “Project groups Google Form” on Moodle.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you are looking for a group to join, please fill out the “Project groups Google Form” on Moodle.</li>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Find a data set that fits these specifications. Note your data may need a little wrangling from its original form.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>(If available) An <a href="https://moderndive-bert.netlify.com/1-getting-started.html#identification-vs-measurement-variables" target="_blank">identification variable</a> that uniquely identifies each observation in each row.</li>
<li>A numerical outcome variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Note: binary outcomes variables with 0/1 values are not technically numerical.</li>
<li>Two explanatory variables:
<ul>
<li>A numerical explanatory variable <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>. Note: this can be some notion of time.</li>
<li>A categorical explanatory variable <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> that has between 3-5 levels. Note: If your data has more than 5 levels, they can be collapsed into 5 using data wrangling later.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At least 50 observations/rows.</li>

<li>Disclaimer: Just because things seem good now doesn’t mean your project data is set for semester. Unforeseen problems may crop up during the next phase on data wrangling, at which point you may need to revise your data. This is a reality of data collection in the real world!</li>
<li>Do not include any <code>View()</code> statements in your <code>.Rmd</code> files as this may cause an error.</li>
<li>Avoid “data dumps”. For example, showing the contents of all 1000 rows in a data frame. This will make your output document really large and unreadable.</li>

# Important note!


> We have posted all four phases of the project at once to give you a sense of what to expect. However, the format and requirements of all four phases of the project will likely slightly change as the semester progresses. **Therefore we suggest that you do not start any upcoming phases of the project until you've been instructed to.**

<div id="revised-project-goals" class="section level1">
<h1>Revised: Project Goals</h1>
<p>The 220 instructor team worked hard to distill this course down to the most important ideas of this class, regardless of the semester or the situation. In pursuit of that distillation, we re-examined each aspect of the course, in particular the project. Our original goals for the project were:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Expose students to the entire data/science pipeline as shown <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html" target="_blank">here</a>, in particular emphasizing exploratory data analysis (EDA) .</li>
<li>Convince students that data collection &amp; wrangling are <strong>essential yet difficult tasks</strong> in statistics. In other words, the high-curated ready-to-go datasets (like those used in our textbook) are not the norm in statistics research.</li>
<li>Consolidate the many many concepts needed to understand inference for multiple regression models into one assignment.</li>
<li>Encourage students to develop a sense of ownership over their work, as compared to problem sets and badge challenges where we – the instructors – select the data, the question of interest, and the method for you.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because a remote learning model of education makes both (1) coordinating group work and (2) getting help with the coding aspects of the project particularly difficult, we’ve decided to revise the project. In this revision, we are balancing working in a learning community with removing the stress of group work. Like the original project, this revised version will have 4 phases. However, the last two phases will differ substantially from the original version:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Project Data (already completed)</li>
<li>Project Proposal (already completed)</li>
<li>Project Submission (revised)</li>
<li>Project Resubmission (revised)</li>
</ol>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="submission" class="section level1">
<h1>3. Revised: Project Submission</h1>
<p>As stated above, we have four goals for this project, and at this point in the process (i.e. after phase two submission) we believe that each statistician in SDS/MTH 220 has explicit experience with at least one of the goals. So for the third “Project Submission” phase of the project <strong>each</strong> student will be submitting a 1000 and 1200 word reflection piece on your experience. Action items:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Begin by taking a few notes on your experience so far. A few things you might want to consider are:
<ul>
<li>What went really well so far?</li>
<li>What were unexpected challenges for you and your team?</li>
<li>What do you wish you had done differently so far?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Then with these notes in mind, read the feedback from Phase 2 (to be delivered by Mon 4/6) and review the feedback from Phase 1. Does the feedback surprise you? Compare and contrast the feedback with your notes.</li>
<li>Now is the time to loop in your group. Have a discussion over either Zoom or Slack about (1) the goals for the project and (2) the feedback. It’s completely normal if each of you resonate with a different goal. Even though you have worked in a group, you are a collection of individuals with different experiences.</li>
<li>With all of this in mind, respond to the following prompt:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>This project has 4 original goals in mind. Select at least one of these goals and discuss how your work so far on the project has already accomplished this goal. Note that we are asking you to write authentically about your experience so far, not to tell us what you think we want to hear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few logistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will write your paper following the instructions in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fMXLAWDMehHWaFp1cOtRcD-pf2aJEnmgQnkcAwQ6Syk/" target="_blank">template Google Doc</a>. It needs to be between 1000 and 1200 words.</li>
<li>Your paper must be written by you, but in the footnote please note when you met with your group and one topic that your group discussed that was not included in your reflection piece.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="resubmission" class="section level1">
<h1>4. Revised: Project Resubmission</h1>
<p>Just as with the original incarnation of the project, there is a resubmission phase. After you have submitted the third phase, we will give you feedback on your submission. For the resubmission, you will submit a revision of your paper that addresses the feedback we’ve given you.</p>
