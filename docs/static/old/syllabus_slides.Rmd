# Objective 1 of 4

## Objective 1

Engage in the data/science research pipeline in as faithful a manner as possible while maintaining a level suitable for novices.


## Course title

> * **Official title**: Introduction to Statistics via Modeling
> * **Unofficial title**: Introduction to **Data Science** and Statistics via Modeling



## What is data science?

Domains include: Neuroscience, polisci, environmental studies, econ, biology, ...

## Why? Dialogue with student...

<!--
Hi professor, I really liked your intro stats class. Can I ask you a stats question on a bio project I'm working on? I have gene expression data in this excel file. How would I run some of the methods we learned in class on it?

## Engage in the data/science research pipeline in as faithful a manner as possible...

In other words, engage with all of this...

## Engage in the data/science research pipeline in as faithful a manner as possible...

... and not just this.

## ... while maintaining a level suitable for novices

We'll be engaging in a **simplified version of the whole** data/science pipeline. Think how children learn "tee-ball" and "play the whole game" first...

## ... while maintaining a level suitable for novices

... and then eventually graduate to softball/baseball.

# Objective 2 of 4

## Objective 2

Develop the toolbox necessary to "think with data":

* Data science
* Data modeling
* Statistical inference


## Data visualization

## Data modeling

Data modeling for

* Explanation: When does $x$ cause $y$?
* Prediction: Based on $x$, can I make good predictions about $y$?

Latter is used in the booming field of *machine learning*:

## Statistical inference

> * Statistical inference is the act of infering about some unknown by taking a sample.
> * But what is inference?


## What is inference?

# Objective 3 of 4

## Objective 3

Take your first steps coding.

Two possible "engines" for this class:

* Mathematics: formulas, approximations, etc
* Computers: simulations, random number generation 

We're going to focus on the latter. What does this mean?


## In this class

Less of this:  | But more of this:
------------- | -------------
<img src="images/formulas.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>  | <img src="images/coding.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/> 



## Coding

> * Previous coding experience is not a prerequisite! This is not a computer science course!
> * Never code from scratch: the "cut/paste/tweak" approach.
> * Most important: learing to code is like learning a new language <center><img src="images/new_language.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/></center>


## Bigger picture

> * 20th century *basic skills*:  Reading, writing, quantitative reasoning
> * 21st century *basic skills*:  Reading, writing, quantitative reasoning, **and coding**







# Objective 4 of 4

## Objective 4

Develop your statistical literacy, a necessary ability for effective citizenship.


## Famous quote

[H.G. Wells](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-source-of-the-H-G-Wells-quote-Statistical-thinking-will-one-day-be-as-necessary-for-efficient-citizenship-as-the-ability-to-read-and-write): 

"Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write."

## Producers vs consumers

> * Some of you might become **producers** of statistics: at work, in your research, etc.
> * But all of you will become **consumers** of statistics: reading the news



## Statistical citizenship
