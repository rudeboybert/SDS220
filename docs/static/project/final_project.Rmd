# Introduction 

1. Introduce your research question
1. Describe your data source and context
1. Add anything else you think the reader should know

This is an example of how to cite your sources so that it shows up in the Citations and References section:^[Crouch, Ian. [How the Left Won the War for Gritty, the New Mascot of the Philadelphia Flyers](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/how-the-left-won-the-war-for-gritty). The New Yorker.

# Exploratory data analysis

```{r}
# Change this code to load your CSV file from the web and do any data cleaning here:
ma_traffic_data <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTM4fElimnYsn6uYW9yq6RcEJyD4gQPkU6u4HGuXfdDqoRnOWGKhsZbFdUyO9VTvfHrkGWotjxGrtI_/pub?output=csv") %>% 
  # Select only the needed variables:
  select(County, Community, Rural_Urban, Functional_Class, Avg_Speed, Total_Volume, Crashes) %>% 
  # Drop rows with missing data for crashes
  filter(!is.na(Crashes))
```


## Describe data

Give people a sense for your data by describing:

1. What each observation in each row corresponds to
1. Sample size
1. Outcome variable $y$
1. Numerical explanatory variable $x_1$
1. Categorical explanatory variable $x_2$ and what the $k$ levels/categories are
1. Display a snapshot of five randomly chosen rows of data

```{r}
# Change this code to show a random sample of 5 rows of the data:
ma_traffic_data %>% 
  sample_n(5)
```


## Summary statistics

```{r}
# Insert code to output a table of summary statistics:

```


```{r}
# Insert code to output a table of summary statistics, but this time
# split by the different levels of the categorical variable:

```


## Data visualizations

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 1: INSERT TITLE", fig.align = "center"}
# Insert code to visualize the distribution of outcome variable:

```

Describe any key insight from Figure 1 here.


```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 2: INSERT TITLE", fig.align = "center"}
# Insert code to visualize the relationship between outcome variable and numerical explanatory variable:

```

Describe any key insight from Figure 2 here.

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 3: INSERT TITLE", fig.align = "center"}
# Insert code to visualize the relationship between outcome variable and categorical explanatory variable:

```

Describe any key insight from Figure 3 here.

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 4: INSERT TITLE", fig.align = "center"}
# Insert code to visualize interaction model:

```

Describe any key insight from Figure 4 here.

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 5: INSERT TITLE", fig.align = "center"}
# Insert code to visualize parallel slopes model:

```

Describe any key insight from Figure 5 here.

## Initial conclusions

Write:

- What insight you would tell your grandmother
- Your initial model selection choice, interaction or parallel slopes model, and why.
